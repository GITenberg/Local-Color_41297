<p class="newchap"><span class="dropcap ml6">Felix Looms</span>, the well-known author,
disappeared&mdash;or, rather, he went away&mdash;on
or about June fifteenth, four
years ago. He told his friends, his landlady
and his publisher&mdash;he had no immediate
family&mdash;he felt run down and debilitated and
he meant to go away for a good long stay. He
might try the Orient; then again perhaps he
would go to the South Seas. When he came
back, which might be in a year or two years or
even three, he expected to bring with him the
material for a longer and better book than any
he had written. Meantime he wanted to cut
loose, as he put it, from everything. He intended,
he said, to write no letters while he was
gone and he expected to receive none.</p>

<p>He gave a power of attorney to a lawyer with
whom he had occasional dealings, left in bank a
modest balance to meet any small forgotten
bills that might turn up after his departure,
surrendered his bachelor apartments in the
<a name="p012" id="p012"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>12<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>Rubens Studio Building, paid off his housekeeper,
said good-bye to a few persons, wrote
explanatory notes to a few more; and then
quietly&mdash;as he did everything in this life&mdash;he
vanished.</p>

<p>Nobody particularly missed him, for he was
not a famous author or even a popular one; he
was merely well known as a writer of tales
dealing in the main with crime and criminals
and criminology. People that liked his writings
said he was a realist, who gave promise of
bigger things. People that did not like his
writings said he was a half-baked socialist.
One somewhat overcritical reviewer, who had a
bad liver and a bitter pen, once compared him
to an ambitious but immature hen pullet, laying
many eggs but all soft-shelled and all of them
deficient in yolk.</p>

<p>Personally Felix Looms was a short, slender,
dark man, approaching forty, who wore thick
glasses and coats that invariably were too long
in the sleeves. In company he was self-effacing;
in a crowd he was entirely lost, if you know what
I mean. He did not know many people and
was intimate with none of those he did know.
Quite naturally his departure for parts unknown
left his own little literary puddle unrippled.</p>

<p>Looms went away and he did not come back.
His publisher never heard from him again; nor
did his lawyer nor the manager of the warehouse
where he had stored his heavier belongings.
When three years had passed, and still no word
<a name="p013" id="p013"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>13<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>came from him, his acquaintances thought&mdash;such
of them as gave him a thought&mdash;that he
must have died somewhere out in one of the
back corners of the East. He did die too; but
it was not in the East. He died within a block
and a half of the club of his lawyer and not more
than a quarter of a mile from the town house of
his publisher. However, that detail, which is
inconsequential, will come up later.</p>

<p>At about seven-forty-five on the evening of
June seventeenth, four years ago, Patrolman
Matthew Clabby was on duty&mdash;fixed post duty&mdash;at
the corner of Thirty-fourth Street and
Second Avenue. According to the report made
by him at the time to his immediate superior
and subsequently repeated by him under oath
before the grand jury and still later at the trial,
his attention was attracted&mdash;to use the common
formula&mdash;by a disturbance occurring on a
crosstown trolley car, eastward bound, which
had halted just west of the corner.</p>

<p>Patrolman Clabby boarded the car to find
a small, shabby man endeavouring to break
away from a larger and better-dressed man,
who held him fast by the collar. In reply to
the officer’s questions the large man stated
that he had detected the small one in the act
of picking his pocket. He had waited, he said,
until the other lifted his watch and chain and
then had seized him and held him fast and
called for help. At least three citizens, passengers
on the car, confirmed the main points of the
<a name="p014" id="p014"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>14<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>accuser’s story. For added proof there were
the watch and chain. They were in the thief’s
side coat pocket. With his own large firm
hands Patrolman Clabby fished them out from
there and confiscated them for purposes of evidence.
As for the prisoner, he said nothing at
all.</p>

<p>The policeman totted down in his little book
the names and addresses of the eyewitnesses.
This done, he took the small man and led him
off afoot to the East Thirty-fifth Street Station,
the owner of the watch going along to make a
formal charge. Before the desk in the station
house this latter person said he was named
Hartigan&mdash;Charles Edward Hartigan, a private
detective by occupation; and he repeated his
account of the robbery, with amplifications.
The pickpocket gave his name as James Williams
and his age as thirty-eight, but declined
to tell where he lived, what occupation he followed,
or what excuse he had for angling after
other people’s personal property on a crosstown
car.</p>

<p>At this juncture Clabby grabbed one of his
prisoner’s hands and ran a finger over its inner
surface, seeking for callosities of the palm; then
he nodded meaningly to the desk lieutenant.</p>

<p>“I guess he’s a dip all right, Loot,” said
Clabby; “the inside of his hand is as soft as a
baby’s.”</p>

<p>“Take him back!” said the lieutenant briefly.</p>

<p>Before obeying, Clabby faced the man about
<a name="p015" id="p015"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>15<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>and searched him, the search revealing a small
amount of money but no objects that might
serve for the prisoner’s better identification.
So, handling James Williams as casually and
impersonally as though he were merely a rather
unwieldy parcel, Clabby propelled him rearward
along a passageway and turned him over
to a turnkey, who turned him into a cell and left
him there&mdash;though not very long. Within an
hour he was taken in a patrol wagon to the
night court, sitting at Jefferson Market, where
an irritable magistrate held him, on the strength
of a short affidavit by Clabby, to await the
action of the grand jury.</p>

<p>Thereafter for a period James Williams, so
far as the processes of justice were concerned,
ceased to be a regular human being and became
a small and inconspicuous grain in the whirring
hopper of the law. He was as one pepper-corn
in a crowded bin&mdash;one atom among a multitude
of similar atoms. Yet the law from time to
time took due cognisance of this mote’s existence.</p>

<p>For example, on the morning of the eighteenth
a closed van conveyed him to the Tombs. For
further example, an assistant district attorney,
in about a month, introduced Clabby and Hartigan
before the July grand jury. It took the
grand jury something less than five minutes
to vote an indictment charging James Williams
with grand larceny; and ten days later it took
a judge of General Sessions something less than
<a name="p016" id="p016"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>16<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>three-quarters of an hour to try the said
Williams.</p>

<p>The proceedings in this regard were entirely
perfunctory. The defendant at the bar had no
attorney. Accordingly the judge assigned to
the task of representing him a fledgling graduate
of the law school. Hartigan testified;
Clabby testified; two eyewitnesses, a bricklayer
and a bookkeeper, testified&mdash;all for the
state. The prisoner could produce no witnesses
in his own behalf and he declined to take the
stand himself, which considerably simplified
matters.</p>

<p>Red and stuttering with stage fright, the
downy young law-school graduate made<!-- original reads 'make' --> a brief
plea for his client on the ground that no proof
had been offered to show his client had a previous
criminal record. Perfunctorily the young
assistant district attorney summed up. In a
perfunctory way the judge charged the jury;
and the jury filed out, and&mdash;presumably in a
perfunctory fashion also&mdash;took a ballot and
were back in less than no time at all with a
verdict of guilty.</p>

<p>James Williams, being ordered to stand up,
stood up; being ordered to furnish his pedigree
for the record, he refused to do so; being regarded,
therefore, as a person who undoubtedly
had a great deal to conceal, he was denied the
measure of mercy that frequently is bestowed
on first offenders. His Honour gave him an
indeterminate sentence of not less than three
<a name="p017" id="p017"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>17<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>years at hard labour in state prison, and one
of the evening newspapers gave him three lines
in the appropriate ratio of one line for each
year. In three days more James Williams was
at Sing Sing, wearing among other things a
plain grey suit, a close hair-cut and a number,
learning how to make shoes.</p>

<p class="tb"><br class="ns"
 />Now then, the task for me is to go back and
begin this story where properly it should begin.
Felix Looms, the well-known writer who went
away on or about June fifteenth, and James
Williams, who went to jail June seventeenth
for picking a pocket, were one and the same
person; or perhaps it would be nearer the truth
to say that James Williams was Felix Looms.</p>

<p>Lest my meaning be misunderstood let me
add that this is no tale of a reversion to type.
It has nothing whatever to do with any suddenly
awakened hereditary impulse. In the
blend of Felix Looms’ breed no criminal strain
persisted. His father was a Congregational
preacher from Massachusetts and his mother a
district school-teacher from Northern New
York. His grandsires, on both sides, were
good, clean-strain American stock. So far as
we know, never a bad skeleton had rattled its
bones in his family’s closet. He himself was a
product of strict training in a Christian home,
a Yale education and much book reading. The
transition from Felix Looms, bookworm, author
and sociologist, to James Williams, common
<a name="p018" id="p018"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>18<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>rogue and convict, was accomplished deliberately,
and, as it were, with malice aforethought.</p>

<p>Here was how the thing came about. Secretly,
through a period of years, Felix Looms
had nursed an ambition to write a great novel
of prison life. It is true he had written a number
of short stories and at least one novelette
dealing with prison life, and, what was more to
the point, had sold them after writing them;
but they lacked sincerity. There was neither
sureness nor assurance about them. He felt
this lack; his publishers felt it; and in a way
his readers no doubt felt it too, without knowing
exactly why they felt it.</p>

<p>It is one of the inexplicable mysteries of the
trade of writing that no man, however well he
handles the tools of that trade, can write convincingly
of things about which he personally
does not know. A man might aspire, let us say,
to write a story with scenes laid in Northern
Africa. In preparation for this task he might
read a hundred volumes about Northern Africa,
its soil, its climate, its natives, its characteristics.
He might fairly saturate himself in literature
pertaining to Northern Africa; then sit
him down and write his story. Concede him
to be a good craftsman; concede that the story
was well done; that his descriptions were
strong, his phrasing graphic, his technic correct&mdash;nevertheless,
it would lack that quality they
call plausibility. Somehow the reader would
sense that this man had never seen Northern
<a name="p019" id="p019"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>19<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>Africa with his own eyes or breathed its air
with his own nostrils.</p>

<p>To this rule there are two exceptions: A
writer may write of things that happened in a
past generation, after the last man of that generation
is dead&mdash;therefore historical novelists
are common; or, provided his imagination be
sufficiently plastic, he may write of things that
are supposed to happen in the future&mdash;he may
even describe the inhabitants of the planet
Mars and their scheme of existence. None will
gainsay him, seeing that no contemporary of
his has been to Mars or knows more of the conditions
that will prevail a year or a century
hence than he knows. But where he deals with
the actualities of his own day and time he must
know those actualities at first hand, else his
best efforts fall to the ground and are of no
avail. He simply cannot get away with it.
Hearsay evidence always was poor evidence.</p>

<p>Felix Looms knew this. In his own case he
knew it better than his readers knew it&mdash;or even
his publisher. Critical analysis of his work had
revealed its flaws to him until in his own soul
he was ashamed and humiliated, feeling himself
to be a counterfeiter uttering a most spurious
coinage. So one day he said to himself:</p>

<p>“The worst thing in our modern civilisation
is a prison. It is wrong and we know it is
wrong; and yet we have devised nothing to
take its place. A prison is crime’s chemical
laboratory; it is a great retort where virulent
<a name="p020" id="p020"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>20<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>poisons are distilled. Civilisation maintains it
in the hope of checking certain gross evils; yet
in it and by it evils as great are born and
fostered. And the truth about it has never
been told in the form of fiction, which is the
most convincing form of telling the truth.
Always the trouble has been that the people
who have been in prison could not write about
it and the people who could write about it have
not been in prison.</p>

<p>“I know I could write about it, and so I am
going to prison. I shall go to prison for one
year, perhaps two or possibly three years; and
when I come out I shall write a novel about
prison life that will make my name live after
me, for I shall know my facts at first hand&mdash;I
shall have the local colour of a prison in my
grip as no other man has ever had it who had
my powers as a writer. I am going to gamble
with this thing&mdash;the prison. I will give it a
slice out of my life for the sake of the great
work I shall do afterward.”</p>

<p>Mind you, I am not saying he put his big
idea&mdash;for surely it was an idea and a big one&mdash;in
exactly those words; but that was his
thought. And when he came to work out the
plan he was astonished to find how easy it was
to devise and to accomplish. Thanks to his
mode of life, his practical isolation in the midst
of five million other beings, he needed to confide
in but one person; and in Hartigan he
found that person. Hartigan, a veteran of the
<a name="p021" id="p021"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>21<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>detective business, who knew and kept almost
as many intimate secrets as a father confessor,
showed surprise just twice&mdash;first when Looms
confided to him his purpose and again when he
learned how generously Looms was willing to
pay for his co-operation.</p>

<p>Besides, as Looms at their first meeting
pointed out and as Hartigan saw for himself,
there was no obligation upon him to do anything
that was actually wrong. Aboard that crosstown
car Looms did really take a watch from
Hartigan’s pocket. Whatever the motive behind
the act, the act spoke for itself. All that
Hartigan told under oath on the witness stand
was straight enough. It was what he did not
tell that mortised the fabric of their plot together
and made the thing dovetail, whole
truth with half truth.</p>

<p>At the very worst they had merely conspired&mdash;he
as accessory and Looms as principal&mdash;to
cheat the state of New York out of sundry years
of free board and freedomless lodgings at an
establishment wherein probably no other man
since it was built had ever schemed of his own
free will to abide.</p>

<p>So Hartigan, the private detective, having
first got his fee, eventually got his watch back
and now disappears from this narrative. So
Felix Looms, the seeker after local colour, gave
up his bachelor apartments in the Rubens
Studio Building and went away, leaving no forwarding
address behind him. So James Williams,
<a name="p022" id="p022"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>22<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>the petty felon, with no known address
except the size number in his hat, went up the
river to serve an indeterminate sentence of not
less than three years.</p>

<p class="tb"><br class="ns"
 />From the hour he entered the Tombs on that
morning of the eighteenth of June, Felix Looms
began to store up material against the day when
he should transmute it into the written word.
Speaking exactly, he began storing it up even
sooner than that. The thrill and excitement of
the arrest, the arraignment before the cross
magistrate in the night court, the night in the
station-house cell&mdash;all these things provided
him with startlingly new and tremendously vivid
sensations. Indeed, at the moment his probing
fingers closed on Hartigan’s watch the mind
pictures began to form and multiply inside his
head.</p>

<p>Naturally, the Tombs had been most prolific
of impressions; the local colour fairly swarmed
and spawned there. He had visited the Tombs
once before in his life, but he knew now that
he had not seen it then. Behind a mask of
bars and bolts it had hidden its real organism
from him who had come in the capacity of a
sightseer; but now, as an inmate, guarded and
watched and tended in his cell like a wild beast
in a show, he got under the skin of it. With
the air he breathed&mdash;and it was most remarkably
bad air&mdash;he took in and absorbed the
flavour of the place.</p>

<p><a name="p023" id="p023"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>23<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span>He sensed it all&mdash;the sordid small intrigues;
the playing of favourites by the turnkeys; the
smuggling; the noises; the smells; the gossip
that ran from tier to tier; the efforts of each
man confined there to beat the law, against
which each of them presumably had offended.
It was as though he could see a small stream of
mingled hope and fear pouring from beneath
the patterned grill of each cell door to unite in
a great flood that roared unendingly off and
away to the courts beyond.</p>

<p>Mentally Felix Looms sought to put himself
in the attitude of the men and women about
him&mdash;these bona fide thieves and murderers
and swindlers and bigamists who through every
waking hour plotted and planned for freedom.
That was the hardest part of his job. He could
sense how they felt without personally being
able to feel what they felt. As yet he took no
notes, knowing that when he reached Sing Sing
he would be stripped skin-bare and searched;
but his brain was like a classified card index, in
which he stored and filed a thousand and one
thoughts. Hourly he gave thanks for a systematic
and tenacious memory. And so day by
day his copy and his local colour accumulated
and the first chapters of his novel took on shape
and substance in his mind.</p>

<p>Lying on the hard bed in his cell he felt the
creative impulse stirring him, quickening his
imagination until all his senses fairly throbbed
to its big, deep harmonies. The present
<a name="p024" id="p024"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>24<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>discomforts of his position, the greater discomforts
that surely awaited him, filmed away to nothingness
in the vision of the great thing he meant
to accomplish. He told himself he was merely
about to barter a bit out of his life for that for
which a writer lives&mdash;the fame that endures;
and he counted it a good bargain and an easy
one.</p>

<p>In the period between his arrest and his conviction
Felix Looms had one fear, and one only&mdash;that
at his trial he might be recognised. He
allowed his beard to grow, and on the day the
summons came for him to go to court he laid
aside his glasses. As it happened, no person
was at the trial who knew him; though had
such a person been there it is highly probable
that he would not have recognised Felix Looms,
the smugly dressed, spectacled, close-shaved
man of letters, in this shabby, squinting, whiskered
malefactor who had picked a citizen’s
pocket before the eyes of other citizens.</p>

<p>With him to Sing Sing for confinement went
four others&mdash;a Chinese Tong fighter bound for
the death house and the death chair; an Italian
wife-murderer under a life sentence; a young
German convicted of forgery; and a negro loft
robber&mdash;five felons all told, with deputies to
herd them. Except the negro, Looms was the
only native-born man of the five. The Chinaman,
an inoffensive-looking little saffron-hided
man, was manacled between two deputies.
Seeing that the state would presently be at
<a name="p025" id="p025"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>25<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>some pains to kill him, the state meantime was
taking the very best of care of him. The remaining
four were hitched in pairs, right wrist
of one to left wrist of the other. A deputy
marched with each coupled pair and a deputy
marched behind. Looms’ fetter-mate was the
Italian, who knew no English&mdash;or, at least,
spoke none during the journey.</p>

<p>A prison van carried them from the Tombs
to the Grand Central Station. It was barred
and boarded like a circus cage&mdash;the van was&mdash;and
like a circus cage it had small grated vents
at each end, high up. A local train carried
them from the station to Sing Sing. From
start to finish, including the van ride, the journey
took a little less than three hours. Three
hours to get there, and three years to get back!
Felix Looms made a mental note of this circumstance
as he sat in his seat next the car window,
with the wife-murderer beside him. He liked
the line. It would make a good chapter
heading.</p>

<p>The town of Ossining, where Sing Sing is, is a
hilly town, the railroad station being at the foot
of a hill, with the town mounting up uneven
terraces on one side and the prison squatting
flat on the river bank on the other. Arriving
at Ossining, special and distinguishing honours
were paid to the little yellow Chinaman. In a
ramshackle village hack, with his two guards,
he rode up a winding street, across a bridge
spanning the railroad tracks, and then along a
<a name="p026" id="p026"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>26<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>ridge commanding a view of the Hudson to the
prison.</p>

<p>The four lesser criminals followed the same
route, but afoot. They scuffled along through
the dust their feet kicked up, and before their
walk was done grew very sweaty and hot. The
townspeople they met barely turned their heads
to watch the little procession as it passed; for
to them this was an every-day occurrence&mdash;as
common a sight as a bread wagon or a postman.</p>

<p>It was not a long walk for the four. Quite
soon they came to their destination. An iron
door opened for them and in they went, two by
two. Felix Looms saw how the German forger,
who was ahead of him, flinched up against the
negro as the door crashed behind them; but
to Looms the sound the door made was a welcome
sound. Secretly a high exaltation possessed
him.</p>

<p class="tb"><br class="ns"
 />For a fact, this man who meant to learn about
prison life at first hand went to the right place
when he went to Sing Sing; for Sing Sing, the
main part of it, was built in 1825-28, nearly a
hundred years ago, when the punishment of
imprisonment meant the punishment of soul
and body and mind. In 1825 the man who for
his misdeeds forfeited his liberty and his civil
rights forfeited also the right to be considered
in any wise a human being. As an animal he
was regarded and as an animal he was treated,
and as an animal he became. The institution
<a name="p027" id="p027"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>27<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>made a beast not only of him but of the man
who was set to keep him. Also, in such by-products
as disease and degeneracy the plant
was especially prolific.</p>

<p>The cell house, the dominating structure
within the prison close, must look to-day very
much as it looked along toward the end of the
third decade of last century. Straight-walled,
angular, homely beyond conception, it rises
high above the stone stockade that surrounds
it. Once its interior was lighted and aired
only by narrow windows. You could hardly
call them windows&mdash;they were like slits; they
were like seams. About twenty years ago large
inlets were cut into the walls. These inlets
admit much air and some light.</p>

<p>As the cell house is the core of Sing Sing, so
the cell structure is its core. In the exact centre
of the building, steel within stone, six levels
of cells rise, one level on another, climbing
up almost to the roof, from which many hooded,
round ventilators stare down like watchful eyes
that never sleep. In each tier are two hundred
cells, built back to back, each row of cells being
faced by narrow iron balconies and reached by
narrow wooden stairways. The person who
climbs one of those flights of stairs and walks
along one of those balconies passes a succession
of flat-banded, narrow iron doors. Each door
has set into it an iron grill so closely barred
that the spaces between the patterns are no
larger than the squares of a checkerboard.</p>

<p><a name="p028" id="p028"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>28<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span>Not a single cell has a window in it. Even
at high noon the interior is wrapped in a sourish,
ill-savoured gloom as though the good daylight
had addled and turned sour as soon as it got
inside this place. The lowermost cells are
always damp. Moisture forms on the walls,
sweating through the pores of the stone like an
exhalation, so that, with his finger for a pen, a
man may write his name in the trickling ooze.</p>

<p>A cell measures in width three feet four
inches; in length, six feet six inches; in height,
seven feet and no inches. It has a cubic capacity
of about one hundred and fifty feet,
which is considerably less than half the cubic
space provided by our Government for each
individual in army barracks in time of war.
It contains for furniture a bunk, which folds
back against the wall when not in use, or two
bunks, swung one above the other; sometimes
a chair; sometimes a stool; sometimes a shelf,
and always a bucket.</p>

<p>For further details of the sanitary arrangements
see occasional grand-jury reports and
semioccasional reports by special investigating
committees. These bodies investigate and then
report; and their reports are received by the
proper authorities and printed in the newspapers.
Coincidentally the newspapers comment
bitterly on the conditions existing at Sing
Sing and call on public opinion to rouse itself.
Public opinion remaining unroused, the sanitary
arrangements remain unchanged.</p>

<p><a name="p029" id="p029"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>29<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span>The man who occupies the cell is wakened
at six-thirty <span class="allsc">A.&nbsp;M.</span> At seven-thirty he is
marched to the mess hall, where he eats his
breakfast. By eight o’clock he is supposed
to be at work somewhere, either in the workshop
or on a special detail. At noon he goes to
the mess hall again. He is given half an hour
in which to eat his dinner. For that dinner
half an hour is ample. At twelve-thirty he returns
to his task, whatever it is. He works
until quarter past three.</p>

<p>He gets a little exercise then, and at four he
is marched to his cell. On his way he passes a
table piled with dry bread cut in large slices.
He takes as much bread as he wants. Hanging
to his cell door is a tin cup, which a guard has
just filled with a hottish coloured fluid denominated
tea. Being put into his cell and locked in,
he eats his bread and drinks his tea; that is his
supper. He stays in his cell until between six-thirty
and seven-thirty the following morning.</p>

<p>He knows Sundays only to hate them. On
Sunday he is let out of his cell for breakfast,
then goes to religious services, if he so desires,
and at eleven o’clock is returned to his cell for
the remainder of the day, with his rations for
the day. When a legal holiday falls on Monday
he stays in his cell from four o’clock on Saturday
until six-thirty Tuesday morning, except for the
time spent at certain meals and at divine
services.</p>

<p>This is his daily routine. From the
<a name="p030" id="p030"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>30<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>monotony of it there is one relief. Should he persistently
misbehave he is sent to a dark cell,
from which he emerges half blind and half mad,
or quite blind and all mad, depending on the
length of time of his confinement therein.</p>

<p>This, in brief, is Sing Sing; or at least it is
Sing Sing as Sing Sing was when Felix Looms
went there. Wardens have been changed since
then and with wardens the system is sometimes
altered. Physically, though, Sing Sing must
always remain the same. No warden can
change that.</p>

<p class="tb"><br class="ns"
 />Had he let it be known that he was a man of
clerkly ways and book learning, Felix Looms
might have been set to work in the prison office,
keeping accounts or filing correspondence; but
that was not his plan. So, maintaining his
rôle of unskilled labourer, he was sent to the
shoe shop to learn to make shoes; and in time,
after a fashion, he did learn to make shoes.</p>

<p>He attracted no special attention in the
shameful community of which he had become
a small and inconsequential member. His had
been a colourless and unobtrusive personality
outside the prison; inside he was still colourless
and unobtrusive. He obeyed the rules; he ate
of the coarse fare, which satisfied his stomach
but killed his palate; he developed indigestion
and a small cough; he fought the graybacks
that swarmed in his cell and sought to nibble
on his body. By day he watched, he learned,
<a name="p031" id="p031"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>31<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>he studied, he analysed, he planned and platted
out his book; and at night he slept, or tried to
sleep.</p>

<p>At first he slept poorly. Bit by bit he accustomed
himself to the bad air; to the pent closeness
of his cell; to the feeling in the darkness
that the walls were closing in on him to squeeze
him to death&mdash;a feeling that beset him for the
first few weeks; to the noises, the coughing,
the groaning, the choking, which came from all
about him; to the padding tread of the guards
passing at intervals along the balcony fronting
his cell. But for a long time he could not get
used to the snoring of his cellmate.</p>

<p>Sing Sing being overcrowded, as chronically
it is, it had been expedient to put Looms in a
cell with another prisoner. To the constituted
authorities this prisoner was known by a number,
but the inner society of Tier III knew him
as The Plumber. The Plumber was a hairy,
thick-necked mammal, mostly animal but with
a few human qualities too. The animal in him
came out most strongly when he slept. As the
larger man and by virtue<!-- original reads 'virture' --> of priority of occupancy
he had the lower bunk, while Looms, perforce,
took the upper.</p>

<p>The Plumber slept always on his back.
When his eyes closed his mouth opened; then,
hour after hour, unceasingly, he snored a
gurgling, rumbling drone. It almost drove
Looms crazy&mdash;that snoring. In the night
he would roll over on his elbow and peer down,
<a name="p032" id="p032"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>32<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>craning his neck to glare in silent rage at the
spraddled bulk beneath him. He would be
seized with a longing to climb down softly and
to fix his ten fingers in that fat and heaving
throat and hold fast until the sound of its exhaust
was shut off forever.</p>

<p>After a while, though, he got used to The
Plumber’s snoring, just as he had got used to
the food and the work and the heavy air and
the cell and all. He got used to being caged
with a companion in a space that was much too
small, really, for either of them. A man can
get used to anything&mdash;if he has to. He even
came to have a sort of sense of comradeship
for his cellmate.</p>

<p>The Plumber was not a real plumber. By
profession he was a footpad, a common highwayman
of the city streets, a disciple in practice
of Dick Turpin and Jack Sheppard; but
possessed of none of those small graces of person,
those prettified refinements of air and
manner with which romance has invested these
masters of the calling.</p>

<p>His title was derived from his method of operation.
Dressed in the overalls of an honest
workingman and carrying in his pocket a pair
of pliers, a wrench and a foot-long scrap of gas
pipe, he ranged the darker streets of his own
East Side at night on the lookout for business.
Spying out a prospective victim, he would first
wrap the gas pipe in a handy newspaper; then,
stalking his quarry from behind, he would
<a name="p033" id="p033"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>33<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>knock him cold with one blow of the gas pipe
on the skull, strip the victim’s pockets of what
cash they contained, and depart with all possible
despatch, casting aside the newspaper as he
went. If there was any blood it would be on
the newspaper; there would be none on the gas
pipe.</p>

<p>Should suspicion fall on its owner&mdash;why, he
was merely a straight-faring artisan, bound
homeward, with certain of the tools and impedimenta
of his trade on his person. It had been
The Plumber’s own idea, this device of the gas
pipe and the evening paper, and he was proud
of it and derisive of the imitators who had
adopted it after he, growing incautious, had
been caught, as it were, red-handed and sent
up the river.</p>

<p>With pride and a wealth of detail he confided
these professional secrets to his spectacled little
bunkie after he came to know him. A fragment
at a time he told Looms of his life, his
likes and dislikes, and his associates in crimedom.
He taught Looms the tricks of the
prison, too&mdash;how to pass messages; how to
curry the favour of the keepers; how, when so
desiring, to smuggle contrabands in and out;
how to talk with one’s neighbours while at work
or at mess, where silence is demanded, which
same is accomplished with the eyes facing
straight ahead and the words slipping sidewise
from the corners of the mouth, the lips meantime
moving but little. Considering the differences
<a name="p034" id="p034"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>34<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>in them, they came to be pretty good
friends.</p>

<p>Evenings and Sundays and holidays The
Plumber would take the floor, literally as well as
figuratively. He would stand at the door of
their cell, shifting from foot to foot like a caged
cat-animal in quarters too small for it, and
sniffing like an animal through the small
squares of the iron lattice; or else he would
pace back and forth the length of the cell, constantly
scraping his body between the wall and
the edge of the upper berth. In these movements
he found relief from his restlessness.</p>

<p>And while The Plumber walked and talked
Looms would lie prone on his bed listening or
making notes. For making these notes he
used an indelible pencil, and for greater security
against discovery he set them down in shorthand.
The shorthand was partly of his own
devising and partly based on an accepted stenographic
system. As fast as he filled one sheet
of paper with the minutely done, closely spaced
lines he pasted it to another sheet; so that in
time he had a long, continuous strip, all written
over thickly with tiny, purplish-blue characters.
Being folded flat and thin and inclosed in an envelope
made of thin leather pilfered from the
shoe shop, this cipher manuscript was carried
by Looms inside his shirt during the day, and
it went under his pillow when he slept. Once a
week he was sent to the baths. At such times
he hid the precious packet beneath his mattress.</p>

<p><a name="p035" id="p035"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>35<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span>The Plumber, of course, had abundant opportunity
to examine these notes; but naturally
enough he could make nothing of them. Privily
he catalogued Looms&mdash;or Williams, which he
thought was his cell-mate’s name&mdash;as a sort of
harmless lunatic; in short, a nut. Looms
meantime made copy out of The Plumber. He
meant to use The Plumber as a character in his
book&mdash;as one of the principal characters. A
criminal of the type of The Plumber ought to
furnish much material; and without his suspecting
it he did furnish much.</p>

<p>At the end of nine months they parted. The
Plumber, having completed his term, went
forth to sin some more. Thereafter Looms
had a cell to himself. Before very long, his
record being clean, he was the recipient of a
mark of favour from the warden’s office. He
became a trusty. As a trusty he was doubly
alert to win special privileges for himself. He
knew all the tricks and devices of the place by
now. Outwardly he was every inch a convict&mdash;a
commonplace convict if not a typical one. Inwardly
he now frequently caught himself slipping
into a convict’s mode of thinking&mdash;found
himself viewing his prison existence, not as an
observer of the system but as an integral part
and parcel of the prison machine.</p>

<p>Drugged by the stupefying monotony of it he
felt sometimes as though he had always been a
convict. The days passed, leaving no conscious
impressions on the retina of his brain. It was
<a name="p036" id="p036"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>36<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>as though he rode on an endless band, which
circled once in twenty-four hours, never changing
its gait or its orbit. It took an effort to rid
himself of this feeling.</p>

<p>The graybacks which crawled over his body
at night, coming out of the cracks of the wall
and the folds of his blanket to bite his flesh,
no longer made him sick, for they were part of
the system too.</p>

<p>Not once did he regret what he had done to
get himself into Sing Sing.</p>

<p class="tb"><br class="ns"
 />The first year went by thus, and the second,
and Looms entered on the third. He still kept
his flat packet of manuscript close and safe,
wearing it in its leather envelope next to his
skin; but now he added no more notes in his
cryptic shorthand code. He told himself he
added no more because he already had at his
fingers’ ends, waiting to be transcribed into
copy, the whole drama of prison life&mdash;the poisons
it distills; the horrors it breeds; its qualities
and its inequalities; its wrongs that might
be reformed and its wrongs that can never be
reformed. This was what he told himself.
The fact remained that for the last seven
months of his imprisonment he set down no notes.</p>

<p>At the end of the third year he was discharged.</p>

<p class="tb"><br class="ns"
 />The man who had entered Sing Sing three
years before was not the man who came out.
<a name="p037" id="p037"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>37<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>The man who went in had been slender and
quick of movement, careful of his personal appearance,
almost old-maidish in his neatness.
He carried himself erectly; he walked with
rather a brisk tread. This man had shapely
hands.</p>

<p>The man who came out resembled the other
in that he was small of frame and wore thick-lensed
glasses. In nearly every other essential
regard he differed from him. Even his height
seemed less, for now he moved with a stoop in
his shoulders and with his head sunken. His
hands dangled at his sides as though they had
grown too heavy for the arms on which they
were hung. They were the hands of one who
has done coarse manual labour&mdash;the nails were
blunted and broken, the palms bossed with warty
calluses. This man walked with a time-killing
shamble, scraping his feet along. Beneath the
natural sallowness of his skin his face had the
bleached, unhealthy look of any living thing
that has been kept too long in artificial twilight,
away from fresh air and sunshine. By
its colour it suggested a pale plant growing in a
cellar, a weed sprig that had sprouted beneath
a log. It suggested a white grub burrowing in
rotted wood.</p>

<p>The greatest change of all, however, was in
the expression of the face; for now the eyes
moved with a furtive, darting movement&mdash;a
quick scrutiny that lingered on its target for a
second only and then flashed away. And
<a name="p038" id="p038"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>38<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>when the lips framed words the mouth, from
force of training, was pursed at the corner, so
that the issuing speech could be heard with
greater distinctness by one who stood alongside
the speaker than by one who faced him.</p>

<p>The clothes Looms had worn when he entered
the prison had disappeared; so for his reentrance
into the world the authorities gave him
a suit of prison-made slops, poorly cut and
bunchily sewed. They gave him this suit of
clothes, a shirt and a hat and a pair of shoes;
also a small sum of money, a ticket back to the
point from which he had been brought, and the
small articles that had been taken from his person
at the time he entered Sing Sing.</p>

<p>These and his sheaf of shorthand notes
pasted together, folded flat and inclosed in his
small leather pack, were all that Felix Looms
brought away with him from the prison.</p>

<p>Once more he went afoot along the dusty
road, followed the ridge along the river, crossed
the bridge above the railroad tracks and descended
to the station below to wait for a train
bound for the city. Persons who were gathered
on the platform looked at him&mdash;some understandingly;
some curiously. He found it easier
to evade their eyes than to return their stares.</p>

<p>Presently a train came and he boarded it,
finding a seat in the smoker. The exaltation
that had possessed him when he went to Sing
Sing was all gone. A certain indefinable numbness
affected his body, his limbs, his mind, making
<a name="p039" id="p039"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>39<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>his thoughts heavy and his movements
sluggish. For months past he had felt this
numbness; but he had felt sure that liberty
and the coming of the time for the fulfillment
of his great work would dissipate it. He was
free now, and still the lassitude persisted.</p>

<p>He viewed the prospect of beginning his novel
with no particular enthusiasm. He said to
himself that disuse of the pen had made him
rusty; that the old enthusiasm, which is born
of creation, of achievement, of craftsmanship
exercised, would return to him as soon as he had
put the first word of his book on paper; and
that after that the story would pour forth with
hardly a conscious effort on his part. It had
been so in the past; to a much greater degree it
should be so now. Yet, for the moment, he
viewed the prospect of starting his novel almost
with physical distaste.</p>

<p>In this mental fog he rode until the train
rolled into the Grand Central Station and
stopped. Seeing his fellow passengers getting
off he roused himself and followed them as they
trailed in straggling lines through the train shed
and out into the great new terminal. It was
late afternoon of a summer’s day.</p>

<p>His plans immediately following his advent
into the city had all been figured out long in
advance. He meant to seek obscure lodgings
until he could secure a few needed additions to
his wardrobe. Then he would communicate
with his publisher and make to him a private
<a name="p040" id="p040"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>40<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>confession regarding his whereabouts during
the past three years, and outline to him the
book he had in mind to write. Under the circumstances
it would be easy to secure a cash
advance from any publisher.</p>

<p>Thus fortified with ready money Looms
would go away to some quiet place in the country
and write the book. Mulling these details
over in his head he shambled along automatically
until suddenly he found himself standing
in Forty-second Street. He slipped backward
involuntarily, for the crowds that swirled by
him daunted him. It seemed to him that they
were ten times as thick, ten times as noisy, ten
times as hurried as they had been when last he
paused in that locality.</p>

<p>For a minute, irresolute, he hesitated in
the shelter of the station doorway. Then,
guided by habit, a thing which often sleeps but
rarely dies, he headed westward. He walked
as close to the building line as he could squeeze
himself, so as to be out of the main channels of
sidewalk travel. When he came to Fifth
Avenue he mechanically turned north, shrinking
aside from contact with the swarms of well-dressed,
quick-paced men and women who
passed him, bound in the opposite direction.
From the asphalt beyond the curbing arose a
clamour of wheels and hoofs and feet which
dinned unpleasantly in his ears, creating a subconscious
sense of irritation.</p>

<p>He moved along, dragging his feet, for two
<a name="p041" id="p041"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>41<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>blocks; then halted on a corner. A big building
rose before him, a building with many open
windows. There were awnings and flower
boxes at the windows; and, looking in at the
window nearest him, he caught sight of well-dressed
men and women sitting at tables.
With almost a physical jolt he realised that this
was a restaurant in which he himself had dined
many a time on such an evening as this; somehow,
though, those times seemed centuries
back of him in a confused previous existence.</p>

<p>A uniformed carriage starter, who stood at
one of the entrances, began staring at him and
he went on up the avenue with his hands
rammed deep into his pockets, his head bent
between his shoulders, and his heels dragging
on the sidewalk. He had a feeling that everybody
was staring at him. It nagged and pestered
him&mdash;this did.</p>

<p>He continued his way for four or five blocks,
or possibly six, for he took no close note of his
progress. Really he had no purpose in this
northward progress; a restlessness he could
not analyse kept him moving. He came to
another building, also with awninged windows.
He knew it for a club. Once or twice, he recalled,
he had been in that club as a guest of a
member, but for the moment he could not
think of its name. Sitting at a window facing
him were two men and in a spurt of reviving
memory he placed one of them as a man
he had known slightly&mdash;a man named
<a name="p042" id="p042"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>42<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>Walcroft, a corporation lawyer with offices downtown.</p>

<p>This man Walcroft stared straight into
Looms’ face, but in his eyes there was no
glint of recognition; only on his face was a
half-amused, half-contemptuous expression as
though he wondered why a person of so dubious
an appearance should be loitering along Fifth
Avenue at such an hour.</p>

<p>Looms, squinting back at Walcroft through
his glasses, felt a poke in the small of the back.
He swung round; a policeman approaching
from the rear had touched him with a gloved
thumb. The look the policeman gave him as
they faced each other was at once appraising,
disapproving and suspicious.</p>

<p>“Move on!” he said briskly. “Keep
movin’!”</p>

<p>“I’m doing nothing,” said Looms slowly; but
as he spoke he backed away a pace or two and
his eyes flickered and shifted uneasily, avoiding
the policeman’s direct and accusing stare.</p>

<p>“That’s the trouble,” said the policeman.
“You’re doin’ nothing now, but you’re likely
to do something if you stay here. Beat it!
You’re in the wrong street!” With an air of
finality the policeman turned away.</p>

<p>Irresolutely the ex-convict retreated a few
yards more, stepping out into the roadway.
Was he indeed in the wrong street? Was that
why he felt so uncomfortable? Yes, that must
be it&mdash;he was in the wrong street! Fifth
<a name="p043" id="p043"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>43<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>Avenue was not for him any more, even though
once he had lived on Fifth Avenue.</p>

<p>As he shambled across to the opposite sidewalk
he shoved his hand up under his hat,
which was too large for him, and scratched his
head in a new perplexity. And then to him,
in a flash, came a solution of the situation, and
with it came inspiration and purpose. It was
precisely in that brief moment that Felix
Looms, the well-known writer, died, he having
been killed instantaneously by the very thing
after which he had lusted.</p>

<p>The man who had been Felix Looms&mdash;Felix
Looms, who was now dead&mdash;headed eastward
through a cross street. He hurried along,
moving now with decision and with more speed
than he had shown in his loitering course from
the station. In turn he crossed Madison
Avenue and Park Avenue and Lexington
Avenue, so that soon the district of big restaurants
and clubs and churches and hotels and
apartment houses lay behind him and he had
arrived in a less pretentious and more crowded
quarter. He reached Third Avenue, with its
small shops and its tenements, and the L structure
running down the middle of it; he crossed
it and kept on.</p>

<p>Midway of the next block he came to a place
where a building was in course of construction.
The ground floor was open to the street, for the
façade, which was to be a shop front, had not
gone up yet. The slouching pedestrian stopped
<a name="p044" id="p044"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>44<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>and looked in searchingly. He saw scattered
about over a temporary flooring, which was laid
roughly on the basement rafters, a clutter of
materials and supplies. He saw a line of gas
pipes and water pipes, which protruded their
ends from beneath a pile of sheathing, looking
rather like the muzzles of a battery of gun barrels
of varied bores.</p>

<p>At sight of this piping the eyes of the passer-by
narrowed earnestly. Over his shoulders,
this way and that, he glanced. There was no
watchman in sight. The workmen&mdash;all good
union men, doubtless&mdash;had knocked off for the
day; but it was not yet dark and probably the
night watchman had not come on duty.</p>

<p>He looked again, and then he stepped inside
the building.</p>

<p>In a minute or so he was out. He had one
arm pressed closely against his side as though
to maintain the position of something he carried
hidden beneath his coat. Head down, he
walked eastward. Between Third Avenue and
Second he found the place for which he sought&mdash;a
small paved passageway separating two
tenements, its street end being stopped with a
wooden door-gate which swung unlocked. He
entered the alley, slipping into the space just
behind the protecting shield of the gate.</p>

<p>When he emerged from here the brick paving
of the passage where he had tarried was covered
with tough paper, torn to ragged fragments.
There was a great mess of these paper scraps
<a name="p045" id="p045"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>45<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>on the bricks. A small leather envelope, worn
slick by much handling, gaped emptily where
it had been dropped in an angle of the wall
behind the door. The man responsible for this
litter continued on his way. His left arm was
still held tight against his side, holding upright
a fourteen-inch length of gas pipe the man had
pilfered from the unfinished building a block
away.</p>

<p>About the gas pipe was wrapped a roll of
sheets of thin paper, pasted together end to
end and closely covered with minute characters
done in indelible, purplish-blue shorthand ciphers.
The sheets, forming as they did a continuous
strip, spiralled about the gas pipe
snugly, protecting and hiding the entire length
of the heavy metal tube.</p>

<p class="tb"><br class="ns"
 />This was about six o’clock. About nine
o’clock Marcus Fishman, a Roumanian tailor,
going to his home in Avenue A from a sweatshop
in Second Avenue, was stalked by a footpad
at a dark spot in East Fifty-first Street,
not far from the river, and was knocked senseless
by a blow on the head and robbed of eleven
dollars and sixty cents.</p>

<p>A boy saw the robbery committed and he followed
after the disappearing robber, setting up
a shrill outcry that speedily brought other pursuers.
One of these stopped long enough to
pick up a paper-covered gas pipe the fugitive
had cast aside.</p>

<p><a name="p046" id="p046"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>46<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span>The chase was soon over. As the fleeing
footpad turned the corner of Fiftieth Street
and First Avenue he plunged headlong into the
outspread arms of Policeman Otto Stein, who
subdued him after a brief struggle. The tailor’s
money was still clutched in his hand.</p>

<p>In the Headquarters Rogues’ Gallery the
prisoner’s likeness was found; also his measurements
were in the Bertillon Bureau, thus identifying
him beyond doubt as James Williams, who
had been convicted three years before as a pickpocket.
Further inquiry developed the fact
that Williams had been released that very day
from Sing Sing.</p>

<p>On his trial for highway robbery, James Williams,
as a confirmed and presumably an incorrigible
offender, was given no mercy. He
got a minimum of five years in state prison at
hard labour.</p>

 </span>CHAPTER II<br
 /><span class="so">FIELD OF HONOR</span></h2>


<p class="newchap"><span class="dropcap ml6">This</span> war, which started with the assassination
of an archduke and his archduchess&mdash;a
thing we are apt to forget
about in the face of a tragedy a billion-fold
greater&mdash;this war, which started thus and
so, already has touched or is touching or yet will
touch, at some angle and in some fashion, every
one of us in every corner of the world. Some it
has touched indirectly, by the oblique. Upon
others, who are as numberless now as the sands
on the shore, it has come with such brutal emphasis
that it must seem to them&mdash;such of them
as survive&mdash;that the whole incredible business
was devised and set afoot for the one and the
sole purpose of levelling them, their lives and
their own small personal affairs in the bloodied
red mire of this thing.</p>

<p>For example, let us take the case of Paul
Gaston Michel Misereux, his orphaned sister
Marie and his orphaned half-sister Helene. In
the summer of 1914 they lived in a three-room
<a name="p048" id="p048"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>48<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>flat in a five-story tenement house in East
Thirteenth Street in New York, not far from
the East River.</p>

<p>New York seemed a long, long way then from
the town of Sarajevo wherein the egg of war
was hatching. Indeed, to the three I have just
named New York seemed a long way from most
of the things which to their uncomplex natures
stood for what was comfortable and domestic
and satisfying. They were desperately homesick
very often for the Paris where they had
been born and reared, and from where they had
emigrated two years before after the death of
their father.</p>

<p>But that summer the homesickness was wearing
off a little. The city, which at the moment
of seeing its notched and fangy skyline as they
came up the bay had appeared to them not as a
gateway into a promised land but as a great
sabre-toothed shark of a city lying in wait to
grind them up between its jaws, and which for
the first few months of their life here had been
so cold, so inhospitable, so strange in all its
ways, so terribly intent upon its own matters
and so terribly disregardful of theirs, was beginning
to be something more than a mere
abiding place to them. To them it was beginning
to be home. The lonesomeness was losing
some of its smart. In another year or two more
France would be the old country and America
would be their country.</p>

<p>Paul fancied himself half an American
<a name="p049" id="p049"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>49<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>already. He had taken out his first papers,
which, as he figured it, made him part way a
citizen. Before very long he would be all a
citizen. Likewise, by the practice of a thousand
petty economies common among the first
generation of foreigners who settle here and
most remarkably uncommon among their descendants,
they were starting in a small frugal
way to prosper. If New York had given them
a stone when they came into it asking for
bread, it was giving them now the bread, and
the butter to go on the bread.</p>

<p>Paul Misereux was a pastry cook. He
worked as assistant to a chief pastry cook in a
basement kitchen under a big, medium-priced
restaurant near Union Square. He was small
and dumpy and unhandsome, with the dead-white
face of a man cook. His skin, seen by
daylight, had a queer glaze on it, like the surface
of a well-fluxed, well-baked crockery.
Once it had been a blistery red; that though
was in the days of his apprenticeship to this
trade. The constant heat of it had acted
upon him as alcohol does upon the complexion
of a man who gets drunk quickly&mdash;it made him
deathly white at the last, but before that it
made him red.</p>

<p>He was the chief breadwinner. Marie had a
place as trimmer and saleswoman in a small
millinery shop on lower Sixth Avenue. Helene,
the half sister and youngest of the three, was the
housekeeper. She was inclined to be frail and
<a name="p050" id="p050"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>50<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>she had a persistent cough. She was not in the
least pretty. For the matter of that, none of
them had any provable claim upon beauty.</p>

<p>So far as looks went Marie was the pick of the
lot. At least she had fine eyes and a trim
round figure that showed to its best advantage
in the close-fitting, smooth-fronted uniform of
her employment&mdash;a black frock with white
collar and cuffs.</p>

<p>That June, there was a balance showing on
the happy side of their partnership ledger.
Paul had his mind set upon some day owning
a business of his own&mdash;a bakeshop, perhaps
even a small café. For her part Marie meant
to be a fashionable milliner in her own right.
When Paul was the proprietor of the biggest
restaurant on Broadway she would be Madame,
the mistress and the owner of the smartest hat-shop
along Fifth Avenue. Helene was content
to go on keeping house for the other two. The
limit of her present ambitions was to be rid of
her cough. To marrying and to the rearing of
families none of them gave thought yet; there
would be time for such things in due season,
after affluence had come. Meanwhile, they
would dwell together and save and save and
save. Deposited to their joint account in the
savings bank, the nest-egg of their hopes grew
at the rate of a few dollars each week, drawing
interest besides; and there was meat in the
pot when they felt the need of meat to stay
them.</p>

<p><a name="p051" id="p051"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>51<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span>Over yonder in Sarajevo a stumpy Serbian
man, with twisted ideas regarding his patriotic
duties, loaded up an automatic pistol and waited
for a certain carriage of state to pass a given
point. The carriage did pass, and presently
the man and the woman who rode in it were
both of them dead&mdash;the first to fall in the war
which as to date claimed so rich a toll of the
manhood of this planet, and which, being the
unslakable glutton that it is, continues to claim
more and more with every day that passes.
The echoes of those pistol shots ran round the
world and round again.</p>

<p>A monarch on a throne in Germany exchanged
telegrams with his beloved cousin in
Russia, and with another revered and venerated
cousin in England, and with a dear but
distant kinsman of his in Belgium, and with a
respected friend, not related to him by ties of
blood or marriage, who chanced for the moment
to be the president of a republic in France.
A family quarrel started up. The quarrel having
progressed to a point where the correspondents
lost their affection for one another, they severally
called upon the people who suffered them
to be what they were to go out and settle the
grudge according to a fashion which originated
when Cain clouted Abel in the first trade-war
of which there is record. Because every other
war from that day to this has been a trade-war,
too, the plan of settlement has remained the
same that was employed by Cain when he made
<a name="p052" id="p052"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>52<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>carrion of his brother. The tools of this fashionable
industry have been altered and greatly
improved, and for that civilisation is to be
thanked; but the results do not in the least
differ from the original forms.</p>

<p>The people obeyed their rulers’ calls. Looking
back on it now it seems to us, who are onlookers,
that there was no good and sufficient
reason why they should have done this, but we
know that obedience in such contingencies is a
habit which has come down to them&mdash;and to
us&mdash;from our remotest common ancestors, and
it runs in our blood with the corpuscles of our
blood. It is like a contagious miasma, which,
being breathed into the body, afflicts all its
victims with the same symptoms. So they put
on the liveries designed for them by their lords
against the coming of just such an occasion&mdash;shoddy-wools,
or khakis, or red-and-blue fustians,
as the case might be&mdash;and they went out,
these men and these boys who were not yet
men, to adjudicate the misunderstanding which
had arisen as between the occupants of sundry
palaces in sundry capital cities.</p>

<p>The tide of war&mdash;such being the pretty phrase
coined by those who would further popularise
the institution&mdash;lapped one shore after another.
It went from hemisphere to continent, from continent
to archipelago, from archipelago to scattered
islands in seas suddenly grown barren
of commerce. It flooded jungles in South
Africa; it inundated the back corners of
<a name="p053" id="p053"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>53<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>Australia; it picked up and carried away on its
backwash men of every colour and of every
creed and of every breed. It crossed the Atlantic
Ocean to New York, and having crossed,
it reached into a basement near Union Square
for Paul Misereux. And the way of that was
this:</p>

<p>France called out her reserves. Paul Misereux,
although half an American, as has been
stated, was likewise a French reservist. So at
length the call came to him. Although he was
French he was not excitable. He accepted the
summons very calmly and as a matter of course.
He had been expecting that it would come,
sooner or later. That same day he visited the
office of the French consul where certain formalities
were speedily concluded. Then he went
home and to his sister and his half-sister he very
quietly broke the news of what had happened
and what he had done; and very quietly they
took it. For they were not outwardly emotional
either.</p>

<p>For six days life in the three-room flat went
on very much as it had gone on before, except
that the sisters went daily now to early mass,
and on the first morning following the brother
did not shave himself when he got up. French
soldiers mainly wear beards, and he meant his
beard should be well sprouted when he reported
for service. At the end of those six days, on
the seventh day, a new assistant pastry cook
began serving in the restaurant cellar and a
<a name="p054" id="p054"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>54<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>steamer drew out of her New York dock with
flags flying, being bound&mdash;God and the submarines
willing&mdash;for foreign parts. On the deck
set apart for the second-class passengers, close
up against the rail that was next the shore, Paul
Misereux stood, a most dumpy and unheroic
figure of a man, with patches of woolly beard
showing on his pale chops, waving his hand,
and with many others singing the Marseillaise
Hymn.</p>

<p>When the steamer was gone from sight down
the river toward open water the sisters left the
pierhead where they had been standing and
went away, Marie to her job in the millinery
place on Sixth Avenue and Helene to hers in the
small flat.</p>

<p>Except that Paul was gone, life for the remaining
two continued for a while after this to
be materially unaltered. Beyond a single long
letter written on the voyage across and posted
upon his arrival at Bordeaux, they had no word
of him. For this, though, he was not to blame.
A thing so systematic it had no aspect of being
of human devisement and subject to human
control had caught him. This system took
him in hand in the same hour that his feet
touched dry land. It gave him a number, it
clothed him in a uniform, put a gun in his hands,
strapped upon his back and about his waist
and on his flanks all the other tools needful for
the prosecution of the highly specialised modern
trade of manslaughter, and set him aboard a
<a name="p055" id="p055"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>55<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>train and started him north. Thereafter the
north swallowed him up and concerning him no
news whatsoever came back. He was an atom
in a world event, and the atoms do not count
even though they contribute to the progress of
the event itself.</p>

<p>While these sisters of his waited, hoping each
day the postman would bring them a letter with
a French stamp and a French postmark on it,
but sorely dreading what the portent of that
letter might be, a stroke of bad fortune befell
them. The man who owned the place where
Marie worked professed to deal in French wares
exclusively; but he had a German name and he
spoke with a German accent. Perhaps he felt
deeply the things some people said to him and
about him and about his Fatherland. Perhaps
he found it hard to be neutral in his words and
all his acts when so many about him were so
passionately unneutral in their words and their
acts. Perhaps in those papers which avowedly
were pro-German, and in those which avowedly
were anti-German, he read editorials
that changed his views on certain subjects.
You see, the tide of war had searched him
out too.</p>

<p>Or perhaps after all he merely realised the
need, in a time when business conditions were
so unsettled, of economising. At any rate one
Saturday, without prior warning, he dismissed
from his employ three of his women workers&mdash;an
outspoken Irish girl, a silent Russian Jewess,
<a name="p056" id="p056"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>56<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>whose brothers wore the uniform of a government
which oppressed them, and a French girl,
this last being Marie Misereux.</p>

<p>Monday morning early Marie was abroad,
trying to find for herself a new job. She was
deft enough with her fingers, but there were
handicaps which denied her opportunity of
proving to any interested person just how deft
those fingers of hers were. For one thing, millinery
shops, big and little, were retrenching in
their expenses or trying to. For another, she
was ignorant of the town and of the ways of
the millinery trade&mdash;her first job had been her
only one. Finally, she had only a faulty knowledge
of English, and that in some lines is yet a
bar against the applicant for work even in the
polyglot, more-than-half-foreign city of New
York.</p>

<p>The week which began with that Monday
morning went by; other Mondays and other
weeks went by, and Marie, walking the soles
off her shoes upon the pavements uptown and
downtown, earned nothing at all. The account
in the savings bank, which always before Paul
went away had grown steadily and which for the
first month or so after he went had grown in a
lesser degree, was dwindling and dwindling.
Now when Helene coughed she pressed her hand
against her side. There was no news of their
brother. Except for a few distant cousins three
thousand miles away, they had no kinspeople.
And in this country they had no friends.</p>

<p><a name="p057" id="p057"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>57<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span>Along the crest of a low hill, like a seam, ran a
succession of shattered tree trunks, hemming
earthline to skyline with ragged and irregular
stitches. Once upon a time, not so very long
before, a fine little grove of half-grown poplars
had crowned that small eminence. But the
cannon and the spouting volleys from the rapid-fire
guns had mowed down every tree, leaving
only the mutilated and homely boles.</p>

<p>Upon one slope of the hill&mdash;the slope that was
nearer the city&mdash;a triangular-shaped patch of
woodland projected its point like a promontory
well up toward the hilltop. The shells had
wrought most grievously here, too, but, being
protected somewhat by the dip in the land, the
forest, as they call such a stretch of park timber
in Europe, had not suffered in the same proportionate
extent that the comb of saplings higher
up suffered. The twistified masses of shot-down
boughs made good cover for the French
sharpshooters.</p>

<p>Just under the far shoulder of the rise, zig-zagging
this way and that after the fashion of a
worm that has stiff joints, was a German trench&mdash;the
foremost German trench of all the myriad
trenches and cross-trenches that formed the
sector of the investments at this particular
point. Behind the Germans as they squatted
in this trench was the village of Brimont. It
had been a village once. Now it was a flattened
huddle of broken masonry and shattered woodwork,
from which arose constantly a sour
<a name="p058" id="p058"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>58<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>stench of rotting things. Back of the site of the
village, where a little valley made out between
more hills, was a sunken road winding off to
the north. Upon either side of the road were
fields gouged by misaimed shells until the
mangled earth looked as though a thousand
swine had rooted there for mast.</p>

<p>That was what the Germans saw when they
looked over their shoulders. What they saw
when they looked straight ahead was, first, the
patch of woodland sheltering their foes and
beyond that, three miles away, the old French
city of Rheims, with the damaged towers of the
great cathedral rising above lesser buildings,
and on beyond, melting away into blue reaches of
space, the fields of Champagne. That is to say,
they could see so much when the weather was
clear, which generally it wasn’t. Nine days in
ten, this time of the year, it rained&mdash;the cold,
constant, searching rain of mid-October. It
was raining on this particular day, and up on
this saucer-rim of land, which ringed the plain
in, the wind blew steadily with a raw bite to it.</p>

<p>Firing back and forth between defenders and
besiegers went on intermittently. At this spot
there was no hard fighting; there had been none
for weeks. Farther way, right and left, along
the battle line which stretched from Switzerland
to the sea, the big guns roared like bulls.
But here the men lay in their shelters and nibbled
at their foes like mice.</p>

<p>On second thought I beg to withdraw the
<a name="p059" id="p059"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>59<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>latter simile. These men were not so much like
mice as they were like moles. For they grubbed
in the earth, as moles do, eating and sleeping,
living and dying down in their mud burrows.
Only, moles keep their fur tidied and fine, while
these men were coated and clogged with the
tough clayey substance in which they wallowed.
It was as much as they could do to keep their
rifles in cleansed working order.</p>

<p>Over in the German trench a slim Saxon
youth was squatted, ankle-deep in cold yellow
water. At intervals he climbed into a small
scarp in the wall of the trench, a kind of niche
just large enough to hold his body, and kneeling
there, with his head tucked down and his
shoulders drawn in, he swapped shots with a
Frenchman in the woods slightly beneath and
directly in front of him. Neither of them ever
saw the other. Each in his firing was guided
by the smack of his enemy’s gun and the tiny
puff of white smoke which marked its discharge;
each knowing in a general way only the approximate
location of the man he coveted to
kill, for after an exchange of shots both would
shift, the German to another scarp, the Frenchman
to another tangle of felled boughs. There
was nothing particularly personal, nothing especially
hateful or passionate in the present ambition
of either. It was merely the job in hand.</p>

<p>As between these two&mdash;the Frenchman and
the German&mdash;there was, excusing the differences
of language and religion, no great amount
<a name="p060" id="p060"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>60<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>of distinction to be drawn. Temperamentally
they were of much the same cast. Each in his
separate small sphere of endeavour had been a
reasonably law-abiding, reasonably industrious,
fairly useful individual, until somebody else,
sitting in a high place, had willed it for him that
he should put by whatsoever task he might be
concerned with and engage in this business of
gunning for his fellow-man.</p>

<p>Their uniforms, to be sure, differed in cut and
colour, or had so differed until the mud of Champagne
had made them of a pattern together.
The German soldier’s helmet had a sharp spike
set in it; the Frenchman’s cap had a flattened
top. Also the German carried his name and
number in a small leather pouch which hung on
a thong about his neck and lay snugly against
the chilled skin of his breast under his shirt,
whereas the Frenchman wore his name and his
number on a small brass token that was made
fast to a slender wire bracelet riveted about his
left wrist.</p>

<p>Concerning these methods of marking men
there had been argument from time to time,
the German authorities contending that their
system is the better of the two. For proof of
the claim they point out that in the case of a
Frenchman an arm may be torn away, bodily
carrying the bracelet and the tag with it, whereas
as regards a German, he may be shot in two
and yet retain his identification label since it is
not so very often that the head is entirely
<a name="p061" id="p061"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>61<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>dissevered from the trunk. Here again, as in
many other details, they contend German efficiency
maintains its superiority over all. On
both sides the matter is discussed dispassionately,
just as the toxic properties of various
makes of poisonous gases are discussed, or
the rending powers of shrapnel upon human
flesh.</p>

<p>About four o’clock in the afternoon the German
climbed up into his favourite scarp once
more. Hoping to draw his opponent’s fire, he
jerked his head up into sight for half a second,
then jerked it down again. The trick worked;
the Frenchman fired, but fired high. The German
shoved his gun barrel out between two
clods, shut both eyes&mdash;for he was by no means
a clever marksman&mdash;and pumped a shot back
in reply. The bullet from his rifle, which was a
long, sharp-nosed, steel-jacketed bullet, devised
in accordance with the most scientific experiments,
found its billet. It struck the Frenchman
as he lay belly downward on the earth with
his gunstock against his cheek. It removed
two fingers of the Frenchman’s right hand,
three fingers of his left hand, tore away his
lower jaw, beard and all, and passed out at the
back of his neck, taking splintered fragments of
his spinal processes with it. He turned over
on his back, flapping with his arms and legs,
threshing about in the wet leaves and in the
mud, making grotesque bubbling sounds down
in his throat.</p>

<p><a name="p062" id="p062"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>62<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span>Pretty soon after that twilight came on and
the rifle firing slackened. The Saxon youth,
never knowing he had killed his enemy, called
it a day and knocked off. He hunkered down
in the slime to eat a tallowy stew of bull meat
and barley from a metal pannikin. It was
nourishing enough, this mess was, but it had the
aspect of swill. Having eaten, he immediately
thereafter crawled, in his wet clothes and soaked
boots, into a sort of dugout hollowed in the
wall of his trench, and slept there with four of
his comrades on a bed of mouldy, damp rye
straw. While they slept the vermin travelled
from one to another of them, making discriminative
choice of which body to bite.</p>

<p>Down in the little forest below, the Frenchman
presently quit flapping and quietly bled to
death. During the night a burial party of his
own people came and found him and shovelled
him underground where he lay. But first the
sergeant in command of the squad removed the
bangle from his wrist. In due course of time,
therefore, word was carried back and back by
succeeding stages to headquarters, and from
there on to Paris, and from Paris on to New
York, so that within a month’s time or a little
less it became the painful duty of a consular
clerk in New York to transmit by mail to the
deceased’s next of kin, a sister, the intelligence,
as conveyed in the official notification, that her
brother, Paul Gaston Michel Misereux, was
heroically dead on the Field of Honour.</p>

<p><a name="p063" id="p063"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>63<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span>For the repose of their brother’s spirit they
had a mass said at the little French Catholic
Church where they worshipped, and in his memory
candles burned upon the altar. Out of a
length of cheap sleazy stuff they made a mourning
frock for Helene. Wearing it, her face
seemed whiter than ever and the two red spots
in her cheeks seemed redder. Marie had the
black frock, with the white collars and cuffs,
which had been her uniform as a saleswoman
in the place on lower Sixth Avenue; she wore
that as she hunted for work. Regardless of
their sorrow, the hunt must go on. It went
on, and was a vain quest. From much weeping
her eyes were swollen and puffy and her face
was drawn out of all comeliness. Even though
through merciful forbearance each forbore to
tell her so, none of those to whom she applied
for work cared to hire so homely appearing a
serving woman. In another week, or at most
two, they would be scraping the bottom of their
savings account.</p>

<p>Before this they had lived on scanty rations,
wasting never a crumb. Now they trimmed the
food allowance still finer. It may have been
the lack of sufficient nourishment that caused
Helene to drop down in a faint on the floor of
the tiny kitchen one evening in the middle of
the second week following the receipt of the
news from the consul’s office. As Marie bent
to raise her head in her arms, a little stream of
blood began to run from one corner of Helene’s
<a name="p064" id="p064"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>64<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>mouth. For some time after she recovered
consciousness and had opened her eyes the
little trickle of blood continued, and Marie,
sitting beside her, wiped it away as fast as it
oozed out between her lips. The younger girl
appeared to suffer no pain, but was very weak.
Marie got her undressed and into her bed in the
small middle room. Then she ran downstairs
to the basement to find out from the caretaker
where the nearest doctor was to be found.</p>

<p>It seemed there was one only two doors away.
He came presently, a testy man of sixty who
was lame. One of his legs was inches shorter
than its mate. He lived in a tenement himself
and his practice was among tenement dwellers,
and he was underpaid and overworked and had
trouble enough sometimes to make both ends
meet. He grew shorter of breath and of disposition
at every step as he wallowed up the
stairs, Marie going ahead to show him the way
to the rear flat at the top of the house. Wheezing
until the sound of his breathing filled the
room, he sat down alongside Helene, and while
he held one of her pipe-stem wrists in his hand
he asked Marie certain questions. Then he
told Marie to go into the front room and wait
for him there.</p>

<p>In ten minutes or less he limped in to her
where she sat with her hands clenched between
her knees and her eyes big and rounded with
apprehension. He thought he closed the intervening
door behind him, but the latch failed to
<a name="p065" id="p065"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>65<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>catch in the slot and it swung ajar for a space
of two or three inches. Neither of them took
note of this.</p>

<p>“She’s quiet now,” he said: “the hemorrhage
is checked. I took a sample of her blood. I’ll
make a blood test to-morrow morning. How
long has this been going on&mdash;this cough?”</p>

<p>A good long time, Marie told him&mdash;several
months. She went on, in her broken English,
to explain: “We thought it was but a bad cold,
that soon she would be <span class="nw">well&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>He broke in on her impatiently:</p>

<p>“That’s what you said before. That’s no
excuse.” He looked about him. “How many
are there of you living here&mdash;just you two?”</p>

<p>“We are quite alone,” she told him. “We
had also a brother, but&mdash;but he now is dead.”</p>

<p>It did not occur to her to tell him how the
brother had died, or when.</p>

<p>“What’s your business?” he demanded.
Then as she seemed not to get his intent, he
added:</p>

<p>“Can’t you understand plain English? What
do you do for a living?”</p>

<p>“Your pardon, doctor; I am a milliner.”</p>

<p>“And this other girl&mdash;your sister&mdash;she’s been
staying at home and doing the housekeeping,
you said?”</p>

<p>She nodded. For a moment there was silence,
she still seated, he before her balancing himself
on the longer leg of the two and on his heavy
cane. “I’ll make a blood test in the morning,”
<a name="p066" id="p066"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>66<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>he said at length, repeating what he had said a
moment before.</p>

<p>“Doctor,” said Marie, “tell me, please, the
truth. My sister&mdash;is she then so ill?”</p>

<p>“Ill?” he burst out at her irritably. “Ill?
I should say she is ill. She’s got tuberculosis,
if you know what that means&mdash;consumption.”</p>

<p>She sucked her breath in sharply. Her next
question came slowly: “What is there then to
do?”</p>

<p>“Well, she couldn’t last long here&mdash;that’s
dead certain. You’ve got to get her away from
here. You’ve got to get her up into the North
Woods, in the mountains&mdash;Saranac or some
place like that&mdash;in a sanitarium or an invalids’
camp where she can have the right kind of
treatment. Then she’ll have a chance.”</p>

<p>By a chance he meant that with proper care
the sick girl might live for three months or for
four, or at the outside for six. The case was as
good as hopeless now; he knew that. Still his
duty was to see that his patients’ lives were prolonged&mdash;if
possible.</p>

<p>“These mountains, I do not know them. We
are strangers in this country.”</p>

<p>“I’ll find out about a place where you can get
her in,” he volunteered. “I’ll bring you the information
in the morning&mdash;names and addresses
and everything. Somebody’ll have to go up
there with her&mdash;you, I guess&mdash;and get her
settled. She’s in no shape to be travelling
alone. Then you can leave her there and
<a name="p067" id="p067"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>67<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>arrange to send up so much a week to pay for
her keep and the treatment and all. Oh, yes&mdash;and
until we get her away from here you’ll
have to lay off from your work and stay with
her, or else hire somebody to stay with her.
She mustn’t be left alone for long at a time&mdash;she’s
too sick for that. Something might happen.
Understand?”</p>

<p>“And all this&mdash;it will cost much money
perhaps?”</p>

<p>The cripple misread the note in her voice as
she asked him this. This flat now, it was infinitely
cleaner than the abodes of nine-tenths
of those among whom he was called to minister.
To his man’s eyes the furnishings, considering
the neighbourhood, appeared almost luxurious.
That bed yonder against the wall was very much
whiter and looked very much softer than the
one upon which he slept. And the woman
herself was well clad. He had no patience with
these scrimping, stingy foreigners&mdash;thank God
he was himself native-born&mdash;these cheap, penurious
aliens who would haggle over pennies when
a life was the stake. And there was no patience
in his uplifted, rumbling voice as he answered
her:</p>

<p>“Say, you don’t want your sister to be a
pauper patient, do you? If you do, just say so
and I’ll notify the department and they’ll put
her in a charity institution. She’d last just
about a week there. Is that your idea?&mdash;if it
is, say so!”</p>

<p><a name="p068" id="p068"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>68<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span>“No, no, no,” she said, “not charity&mdash;not for
my sister.”</p>

<p>“I thought as much,” he said, a little mollified.
“All right then, I’ll write a letter to the
sanitarium people; they ought to make you a
special rate. Oh, it’ll cost you twenty-five dollars
a week maybe&mdash;say, at the outside, thirty
dollars a week. And that’ll be cheap enough,
figuring in the food she’ll have to have and the
care and the nursing and all. Then, of course,
there’ll be your railroad tickets on top of that.
You’d better have some ready money on hand
so we can get her shipped out of here before
it’s too&mdash;Well, before many days anyhow.”</p>

<p>She nodded.</p>

<p>“I shall have the money,” she promised.</p>

<p>“All right,” he said; “then you’d better
hand me two dollars now. That’s the price of
my call. I don’t figure on charging you for
making the blood test. And the information
about the sanitarium and the letter I’m going
to write&mdash;I’ll throw all that in too.”</p>

<p>She paid him his fee from a small handbag.
At the hall door he paused on his stumping way
out.</p>

<p>“I think she’ll be all right for to-night&mdash;I
gave her something,” he said with a jerk of his
thumb toward the middle room. “If you just
let her stay quiet that’ll be the best thing for
her. But you’d better run in my place the
first thing in the morning and tell me how she
passed the night. Good night.”</p>

<p><a name="p069" id="p069"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>69<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span>“Good night, doctor&mdash;and we thank you!”</p>

<p>He went clumping down the steps, cursing
the darkness of the stairwell and the steep pitch
of the stairs. Before the sound of his fumbling
feet had quite died away Marie, left alone, had
made up her mind as to a certain course. In
so short a time as that had the definite resolution
come to her. And as she still sat there, in
an attitude of listening, Helene, in the middle
room, dragged herself up from her knees where
she had been crouched at the slitted door between.
She had heard all or nearly all the
gruff lame doctor said. Indeed, she had sensed
the truth for herself before she heard him speak
it. What he told her sister was no news to
the eavesdropper; merely it was confirmation
of a thing she already knew. Once up on her
bare feet, she got across the floor and into her
bed, and put her head on the pillow and closed
her eyes, counterfeiting sleep. In her mind,
too, a plan had formed.</p>

<p>It was only a minute or two after this that
Marie came silently to the door and peered in,
looking and listening. She heard the regular
sound of the sick girl’s breathing. By the light
of the gas that was turned down low she saw,
or thought she saw, that Helene was asleep.
She closed the door very softly. She freshened
her frock with a crisp collarband and with crisp
wristbands. She clasped about her neck a
small gold chain and she put on her head her
small, neat black hat. And then this girl, who
<a name="p070" id="p070"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>70<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>meant to defile her body, knelt alongside her
bed and prayed the Blessed Virgin to keep her
soul clean.</p>

<p>With her handbag on her arm she passed out
into the hall. Across the hall a Jewish family
lived&mdash;by name, the Levinski family&mdash;consisting
of a father who was a push-cart peddler, a
gross and slattern mother who was continually
occupied with the duties of being a mother, and
any number of small Levinskis. In answer to
her knock at their door, Mrs. Levinski came, a
shapeless, vast shape in her night dress, bringing
with her across the threshold strong smells
of stale garlic, soiled flannel and cold fried carp.
Marie had a nodding acquaintance with this
neighbour of hers and no more.</p>

<p>“My sister, she is sick,” she told Mrs. Levinski.
“And I must go out. Please, will you
listen? If she should awake and call out for
me, you will please to tell her I am gone but
soon will be back again. If you please?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Levinski said she would, and to show
she meant it opened wide her door before she
returned to her household duties.</p>

<p>For November the weather was warm, but it
was damp and would be damper. A fine drizzle
was falling as Marie Misereux came to the lower
hallway entrance and looked out into the night;
and East Thirteenth Street, which is never entirely
empty, was almost empty. She hesitated
a moment, with her left hand clenched
tight against her breast, and then stepped out,
<a name="p071" id="p071"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>71<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>heading westward. At the first avenue crossing
she came upon a man, a fairly well-dressed
man, who stood below the stoop of a private
house that had been converted into some sort
of club, as if undecided in his own mind whether
to go in or to stay out. She walked straight
up to him.</p>

<p>“Will you go with me, m’sieur?” she said.</p>

<p>He peered at her from under his hatbrim.
Almost over them was a street lamp. By its
light he saw that her face was dead white; that
neither her lips nor her cheeks were daubed
with cosmetics, and that her lips were not
twisted into the pitiable, painted smile of the
streetwalker. Against the smooth fulness of
her dress her knotted left hand made a hard,
white clump. Her breasts, he saw, heaved up
and down as though she had been running and
her breath came out between her teeth with a
whistling sound. Altogether she seemed most
oddly dressed and most oddly mannered for
the part she played.</p>

<p>“You want me to go with you?” he asked,
half incredulously, half suspiciously, still staring
hard.</p>

<p>“If&mdash;if you will be so good.”</p>

<p>“Do you need the money that bad?”</p>

<p>“Assuredly, m’sieur,” she said with a simple,
desperate directness. “Why else would I ask you?”</p>

<p>“Say,” he said almost roughly, “you better
go on home. I don’t believe you belong on the
streets. Here!”</p>

<p><a name="p072" id="p072"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>72<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span>He drew something that was small and crumply
from a waistcoat pocket, and drawing a step
nearer to her he shoved it between two of the
fingers of her right hand.</p>

<p>“Now, then,” he said, “you take that and
hustle on back home.”</p>

<p>He laughed, then, shamefacedly and in a
forced sort of way, as though embarrassed by
his own generosity, and then he turned and
went quickly up the steps and into the club
house.</p>

<p>She looked at what he had given her. It was
a folded dollar bill. As though it had been
nasty to the touch, she dropped it and rubbed
her hand upon her frock, as if to cleanse it of a
stain. Then, in the same instant nearly, she
stooped down and picked up the bill from the
dirty pavement and kissed it and opened her
black handbag. Except for a few cents in
change, the bag was empty. Except for those
few cents and a sum of less than ten dollars yet
remaining in the savings bank, the two dollars
she had given the lame doctor was all the money
she had in the world. She tucked the bill up
in still smaller compass and put it in the bag.
She had made the start for the fund she meant
to have. It was not charity. In the sweat of
her agonized soul she had earned it.</p>

<p>She crossed over the first bisecting avenue to
the westward, and the second; she passed a few
pedestrians, among them being a policeman trying
door latches, a drunken man whose body
<a name="p073" id="p073"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>73<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>swayed and whose legs wove queer patterns as
he walked, and half a dozen pale, bearded men
who spoke Yiddish and gestured volubly with
their hands as they went by in a group. At
Third Avenue she turned north, finding the
pavements more thickly populated, and just
after she came to where Fourteenth Street
crosses she saw a heavily built, well-dressed
man in a light overcoat, coming toward her at
a deliberative, dawdling gait. She put herself
directly in his path. He checked his pace to
avoid a collision and looked at her speculatively,
with one hand fingering his moustache.</p>

<p>“Will you go with me?” she said, repeating
the invitation she had used before.</p>

<p>“Where to?” he said, showing interest.</p>

<p>“Where you please,” she said in her halting
speech.</p>

<p>“You’re on,” he said. He fell in alongside
her, facing her about and slipping a hand well
inside the crook of her right arm.</p>

<p>“You&mdash;you will go with me?” she asked.
Suddenly her body was in a tremble.</p>

<p>“No, sister,” he stated grimly, “I ain’t goin’
with you but you’re sure goin’ with me.” And
as he said it he tightened his grip upon her
forearm.</p>

<p>He had need to say no more. She knew what
had happened. She had not spent two years
and better in a New York tenement without
learning that there were men of the police&mdash;detectives
they called them in English&mdash;who
<a name="p074" id="p074"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>74<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>wore no uniforms but went about their work
apparelled as ordinary citizens. She was arrested,
that was plain enough, and she understood
full well for what she had been arrested.
She made no outcry, offered no defence, broke
forth into no plea for release. Indeed her
thought for the moment was all for her half-sister
and not for herself. So she said nothing
as he steered her swiftly along.</p>

<p>At a street light where a patrol telephone box
of iron was bolted to the iron post the plain-clothes
man slowed up. Then he changed his
mind.</p>

<p>“Guess I won’t call the wagon,” he said. “I
happen to know it’s out. It ain’t far. You
and me’ll walk and take the air.” He turned
with her westward through the cross street.
Then, struck by her silence, he asked a question:</p>

<p>“A Frenchy, ain’t you?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she told him. “I am French. Where&mdash;where
are you taking me, m’sieur? Is it to
the prison&mdash;the station house?”</p>

<p>“Quit your kiddin’,” he said mockingly. “I
s’pose you don’t know where we’re headin’?
Night court for yours&mdash;Jefferson Market.
Right over here across town.”</p>

<p>“They will not keep me there long? They
will permit me to go if I pay a fine, eh? A small
fine, eh? That is all they will do to me, is it
not so?”</p>

<p>He grunted derisively. “Playin’ ignorant,
huh? I s’pose you’re goin’ to tell me now
<a name="p075" id="p075"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>75<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>you ain’t never been up in the night court
before?”</p>

<p>“No, no, m’sieur, never&mdash;I swear it to you.
Never have I been&mdash;been like this before.”</p>

<p>“That’s what they all say. Well, if you can
prove it&mdash;if you ain’t got any record of previous
complaints standin’ agin’ you, and your finger
prints don’t give you away&mdash;you’ll get off pretty
light, maybe, but not with a fine. I guess the
magistrate’ll give you a bit over on the Island&mdash;maybe
thirty days, maybe sixty. Depends
on how he’s feelin’ to-night.”</p>

<p>“The Island?”</p>

<p>“Sure, Blackwell’s Island. A month over
there won’t do you no harm.”</p>

<p>“I cannot&mdash;you must not take me,” she
broke out passionately now. “For thirty days?
Oh, no, no, m’sieur!”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, yes, yes!” He was mimicking her
tone. “I guess you can stand doin’ your thirty
days if the rest of these cruisers can. If you
should turn out to be an old offender it’d likely
be six <span class="nw">months&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>He did not finish the sentence. With a
quick, hard jerk she broke away from him and
turned and ran back the way she had come.
She dropped her handbag and her foot spurned
it into the gutter. She ran straight, her head
down, like a hunted thing sorely pressed. Her
snug skirt hampered her though. With long
strides the detective overtook her. She fought
him off silently, desperately, with both hands,
<a name="p076" id="p076"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>76<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>with all her strength. He had to be rough with
her&mdash;but no rougher than the emergency warranted.
He pressed her flat up against a building
and, holding her fast there with the pressure
of his left arm across her throat, he got his nippers
out of his pocket. Another second or two
more of confused movement and he had her
helpless. The little steel curb was twined tight
about her right wrist below the rumpled white
cuff. By a twist of the handles which he held
gripped in his palm he could break the skin.
Two twists would dislocate the wrist bone. A
strong man doesn’t fight long after the links of
the nippers start biting into his flesh.</p>

<p>“Now, then,” he grunted triumphantly, jerking
her out alongside him, “I guess you’ll trot
along without balkin’. I was goin’ to treat you
nice but you wouldn’t behave, would you?
Come on now and be good.”</p>

<p>He glanced backward over his shoulder.
Three or four men and boys, witnesses to the
flight and to the recapture, were tagging along
behind them.</p>

<p>“Beat it, you,” he ordered. Then as they
hesitated: “Beat it now, or I’ll be runnin’ somebody
else in.” They fell back, following at a
safer distance.</p>

<p>He had led his prisoner along for almost a
block before he was moved to address her again:</p>

<p>“And you thought you could make your
getaway from me? Not a chance! Say, what
do you want to act that way for, makin’ it
<a name="p077" id="p077"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>77<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>harder for both of us? Say, on the level now,
ain’t you never been pinched before?”</p>

<p>She thought he meant the pressure of the
steel links on her wrist.</p>

<p>“It is not that,” she said, bending the curbed
hand upward. “That I do not think of. It is
of my sister, my sister Helene, that I think.”
Her voice for the first time broke and shivered.</p>

<p>“What about your sister?” There was something
of curiosity but more of incredulity in his
question.</p>

<p>“She is ill, m’sieur, very ill, and she is alone.
There is no one but me now. My brother&mdash;he
is dead. It is for her that I have done&mdash;this&mdash;this
thing to-night. If I do not return to her&mdash;if
you do not let me go back&mdash;she will die,
m’sieur. I tell you she will die.”</p>

<p>If she was acting it was good acting. Half
convinced against his will of her sincerity, and
half doubtfully, he came to a standstill.</p>

<p>“Where do you live&mdash;is it far from here?”</p>

<p>“It is in this street, m’sieur. It is not far.”
He could feel her arm quivering in the grip of
his nippers.</p>

<p>“Maybe I’m makin’ a sucker of myself,” he
said dubiously, defining the diagnosis as much
to himself as to her. “But if it ain’t far I
might walk you back there and give this here
sister of yours the once-over. And then if you
ain’t lyin’ we’ll <span class="nw">see&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>“Must I go so?” She lifted her hand up,
indicating her meaning.</p>

<p><a name="p078" id="p078"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>78<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span>“You bet your life you’re goin’ that way or
not at all. I’m takin’ no more chances with
you.”</p>

<p>“But it would kill her&mdash;she would die to see
me so. She must not know I have done this
thing, m’sieur. She must not see <span class="nw">this&mdash;&mdash;</span>”
The little chain rattled.</p>

<p>“Come on,” he ordered in a tone of finality.
“I thought that sick sister gag was old stuff,
but I was goin’ to give you a show to make
<span class="nw">good&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>“But I <span class="nw">swear&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>“Save your breath! Save your breath! Tell
your spiel to the judge. Maybe he’ll listen.
I’m through.”</p>

<p>They were almost at the doors of the squat
and ugly building which the Tenderloin calls
Jeff Market when he noticed that her left hand
was clutched against her breast. He remembered
then she had held that hand so when she
first spoke to him; except during her flight and
the little struggle after he ran her down, she
must have been holding it so all this time.</p>

<p>“What’s that you’ve got in your hand?” he
demanded suspiciously, and with a practiced
flip of the nipper handles swung her round so
that she faced him.</p>

<p>“It is my own, m’sieur. It <span class="nw">is&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>“Nix, nix with that. I gotta see. Open up
them fingers.”</p>

<p>She opened her hand slowly, reluctantly.
The two of them were in the shadow of the
<a name="p079" id="p079"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>79<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>elevated structure then, close up alongside a pillar,
and he had to peer close to see what the
object might be. Having seen he did not offer
to touch it, but he considered his prisoner closely,
taking her in from her head to her feet, before
he led her on across the roadway and the
pavement and in at one of the doors of that
odoursome clearing house of vice and misery,
mercy and justice, where the night court sits
seven nights a week.</p>

<p>First, though, he untwisted the disciplinary
little steel chain from about her wrist. The
doorway by which they entered gave upon the
Tenth Street face of the building and admitted
them into a maze of smelly dim corridors and
cross-halls in the old jail wing directly beneath
the hideous and aborted tower, which in a neighbourhood
of stark architectural offences makes
of Jefferson Market courthouse a shrieking
crime against good looks and good taste.</p>

<p>The inspector’s man escorted the French girl
the length of a short passage. At a desk which
stood just inside the courtroom door he detained
her while a uniformed attendant entered her
name and her age, which she gave as twenty-one,
and her house number, in a big book which
before now has been Doomsday Book for many
a poor smutted butterfly of the sidewalks. The
detective, standing by, took special note of the
name and the address and, for his own purposes,
wrote them both down on a scrap of card. This
formality being finished, the pair crossed the
<a name="p080" id="p080"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>80<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>half-filled courtroom, he guiding by a hand on
her elbow, she obeying with a numbed and
passive docility, to where there is a barred-in
space like an oversized training den for wild
animals. This cage or coop, whichever you
might choose to call it, has a whited cement
wall for its back, and rows of close-set rounded
iron bars for its front and sides, and wooden
benches for its plenishings. The bars run
straight up, like slender black shadows caught
and frozen into solidity, to the soiled ceiling
above; they are braced across with iron horizontals,
which makes the pen strong enough to
hold a rhino. Its twin stands alongside it,
filling the remaining space at the far side of
the big room. In the old days one pen was
meant for male delinquents and one for female.
But now the night court for men holds its sessions
in a different part of town and only women
delinquents are brought to this place. It may
or may not be a reflection upon our happy
civilisation&mdash;I leave that point for the sociologists
to settle&mdash;but it is a fact that ninety per
cent of them are brought here charged with the
same thing.</p>

<p>The first coop held perhaps a dozen women
and girls. One of them was quietly weeping.
The others, looking, as they sat on one of the
benches in their more or less draggled finery,
like a row of dishevelled cage birds of gay plumage,
maintained attitudes which ranged from
the highly indifferent to the excessively defiant.
<a name="p081" id="p081"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>81<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>The detective unlatched the door, which was of
iron wattles too, and put his prisoner inside.</p>

<p>“You’ll have to stay here awhile,” he bade
her. His tone was altered from that which he
had employed toward her at any time before.
“Just set down there and be comfortable.”</p>

<p>But she did not sit. She drew herself close
up into a space where wall and wall, meeting
at right angles, made a corner. Her cellmates
eyed her. Being inclined to believe from her
garb that she probably was a shopgirl caught
pilfering, none of them offered to hail her; all of
them continued, though, to watch her curiously.
As he closed and bolted the door and moved
away the plain-clothes man, glancing back,
caught a fair look at her face behind the iron
uprights. Her big, staring eyes reminded him
of something, some creature, he had seen somewhere.
Later he remembered. He had seen
that same look out of the staring eyes of animals,
lying with legs bound on the floor of a
slaughterhouse.</p>

<p>Following this, the ordinary procedure for
him would have been to call up the East Twenty-second
Street station house by telephone and
report that, having made an arrest, he had seen
fit to bring his prisoner direct to court; then
visit the complaint clerk’s office in a little
cubby-hole of a room, and there swear to a short
affidavit setting forth the accusation in due
form; finally, file the affidavit with the magistrate’s
clerk and stand by to await the calling
<a name="p082" id="p082"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>82<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>of that particular case. Strangely enough, he
did none of these things.</p>

<p>Instead, he made his way direct to the magistrate’s
desk inside the railing which cut the
room across from side to side. The pent, close
smell of the place was fit to sicken men unused
to it. It commingled those odours which seem
always to go with a police court&mdash;of unwashed
human bodies, of iodoform, of stale fumes of
alcohol, of cheap rank perfumery. Petty crime
exhales an atmosphere which is peculiarly its
own. This man was used to this smell. Smelling
it was to him a part of the day’s work&mdash;the
night’s work rather.</p>

<p>The magistrate upon the bench was a young
magistrate, newly appointed by the mayor to
this post. Because he belonged to an old family
and because his sister had married a rich
man the papers loved to refer to him as the
society judge. As the detective came up he
was finishing a hearing which had lasted less
than three minutes.</p>

<p>“Any previous record as shown by the finger
prints and the card indexes?” he was asking of
the officer complainant.</p>

<p>“Three, Your Honour,” answered the man
glibly. “Suspended sentence oncet, thirty days
oncet, thirty days oncet again. Probation
officer’s report shows that this here young
<span class="nw">woman&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>“Never mind that,” said the magistrate; “six
months.”</p>

<p><a name="p083" id="p083"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>83<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span>The officer and the woman who had been sentenced
to six months fell back, and the detective
shoved forward, putting his arms on the top of
the edge of the desk to bring his head closer
to the magistrate.</p>

<p>“Your Honour,” he began, speaking in a sort
of confidential undertone, “could I have a word
with you?”</p>

<p>“Go ahead, Schwartzmann,” said the magistrate,
bending forward to hear.</p>

<p>“Well, Judge, a minute ago I brought a girl
in here; picked her up at Fourteenth Street and
Thoid Avenue for solicitin’. So far as that goes
it’s a dead-open-and-shut case. She come up
to me on the street and braced me. She wasn’t
dressed like most of these Thoid-Avenue cruisers
dress and she’s sort of acted as if she’d never
been pinched before&mdash;tried to give me an argument
on the way over. Well, that didn’t get
her anywheres with me. You can’t never tell
when one of them dames will turn out in a new
make-up, but somethin’ that happened when
we was right here outside the door&mdash;somethin’
I seen about her&mdash;sort <span class="nw">of&mdash;&mdash;</span>” He broke off
the sentence in the middle and started again.
“Well, anyhow, Your Honour, I may be makin’
a sucker of myself, but I didn’t swear out no
affidavit and I ain’t called up the station house
even. I stuck her over there in the bull-pen
and then I come straight to you.”</p>

<p>The magistrate’s eyes narrowed. Thus early
in his experience as a police judge he had learned&mdash;and
<a name="p084" id="p084"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>84<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>with abundant cause&mdash;to distrust the
motives of plain-clothes men grown suddenly
philanthropic. Besides, in the first place, this
night court was created to circumvent the unholy
partnership of the bail-bond shark and the
police pilot fish.</p>

<p>“Now look here, Schwartzmann,” he said
sharply, “you know the law&mdash;you know the
routine that has to be followed.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, I do,” agreed Schwartzmann; “and
if I’ve made a break I’m willin’ to stand the
gaff. Maybe I’m makin’ a sucker of myself,
too, just like I said. But, Judge, there ain’t
no great harm done yet. She’s there in that pen
and you know she’s there and I know she’s
there.”</p>

<p>“Well, what’s the favour you want to ask of
me?” demanded His Honour.</p>

<p>“It’s like this: I want to slip over to the address
she gave me and see if she’s been handin’
me the right steer about certain things. It
ain’t so far.” He glanced down at the scribbled
card he held in his hand. “I can get over there
and get back in half an hour at the outside.
And then if she’s been tryin’ to con me I’ll go
through with it&mdash;I’ll press the charge all right.”
His jaw locked grimly on the thought that his
professional sagacity was on test.</p>

<p>“Well, what is her story?” asked the magistrate.</p>

<p>“Judge, to tell you the truth it ain’t her story
so much as it’s somethin’ I seen. And if I’m
<a name="p085" id="p085"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>85<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>makin’ a sucker of myself I’d rather not say
too much about that yet.”</p>

<p>“Oh, go ahead,” assented the magistrate,
whose name was Voris. “There’s no danger of
the case being called while you’re gone, because,
as I understand you, there isn’t any case to
call. Go ahead, but remember this while you’re
gone&mdash;I don’t like all this mystery. I’m going
to want to know all the facts before I’m done.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, sir,” said Schwartzmann, getting
himself outside the railed inclosure. “I’ll
be back in less’n no time, Your Honour.”</p>

<p>He wasn’t, though. Nearly an hour passed
before an attendant brought Magistrate Voris
word that Officer Schwartzmann craved the
privilege of seeing His Honour alone for a minute
or two in His Honour’s private chamber. The
magistrate left the bench, suspending the business
of the night temporarily, and went; on the
way he was mentally fortifying himself to be
severe enough if he caught a plain-clothes man
trying to trifle with him.</p>

<p>“Well, Schwartzmann?” he said shortly as
he entered the room.</p>

<p>“Judge,” said the detective, “the woman
wasn’t lyin’. She told me her sister was sick
alone in their flat without nobody to look after
her and that her brother was dead. I don’t
know about the brother&mdash;at least I ain’t sure
about him&mdash;but the sister was sick. Only she
ain’t sick no more&mdash;she’s dead.”</p>

<p>“Dead? What did she die of?”</p>

<p><a name="p086" id="p086"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>86<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span>“She didn’t die of nothin’&mdash;she killed herself
with gas. She turned the gas on in the room
where she was sick in bed. The body was still
warm when I got there. I gave her first aid,
but she was gone all right. She wasn’t nothin’
more than a shell anyhow&mdash;had some wastin’
disease from the looks of her; and I judge it
didn’t take but a few whiffs to finish her off.
I called in the officer on post, name of Riordan,
and I notified the coroner’s office myself over
the telephone, and they’re goin’ to send a man
up there inside of an hour or so to take charge
of the case.</p>

<p>“And so, after that, feelin’ a sort of personal
interest in the whole thing, as you might say,
I broke the rules some more. When I found
this here girl dead she had two pieces of paper
in her hand; she’d died holdin’ to ’em. One
of ’em was a letter that she’d wrote herself, I
guess, and the other must ’a’ been a letter
from somebody else&mdash;kind of an official-lookin’
letter. Both of ’em was in French. I don’t
know exactly why I done it, unless it was I
wanted to prove somethin’ to myself, but I
brought off them two letters with me and
here they are, sir. I’m hopin’ to get
your court interpreter to translate ’em for
me, and then I aim to rush ’em back
over there before the coroner’s physician
gets in, and put ’em back on that bed where
I found ’em.”</p>

<p>“I read French&mdash;a little,” said the young
<a name="p087" id="p087"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>87<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>magistrate. “Suppose you let me have a look
at them first.”</p>

<p>Schwartzmann surrendered them and the
magistrate read them through. First he read
the pitiably short, pitiably direct farewell lines
the suicide had written to her half-sister before
she turned on the gas, and then he read the
briefly regretful letter of set terms of condolence,
which a clerk in a consular office had in duty
bound transcribed. Having read them through,
this magistrate, who had read in the newspapers
of Liège and Louvain, of Mons and Charlevois,
of Ypres and Rheims, of the Masurien Lakes
and Poland and Eastern Prussia and Western
Flanders and Northern France; who had read
also the casualty reports emanating at frequent
intervals from half a dozen war offices, reading
the one as matters of news and the other, until
now, as lists of steadily mounting figures&mdash;he
raised his head and in his heart he silently
cursed war and all its fruits. And next day he
went and joined a league for national preparedness.</p>

<p>“Schwartzmann,” he said as he laid the papers
on his desk, “I guess probably your prisoner
was telling the whole truth. She did have
a brother and he is dead. He was a French
soldier and he died about a month or six weeks
ago&mdash;on the Field of Honour, the letter says.
And this note that the girl left, I’ll tell you
what it says. It says that she heard what the
doctor said about her&mdash;there must have been
<a name="p088" id="p088"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>88<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>a doctor in to see her some time this evening&mdash;and
that she knows she can never get well, and
that they are about out of money, and that she
is afraid Marie&mdash;Marie is the sister who’s in
yonder now, I suppose&mdash;will do something desperate
to get money, so rather than be a burden
on her sister she is going to commit a mortal
sin. So she asks God to forgive her and let
her be with her brother Paul&mdash;he’s the dead
brother, no doubt&mdash;when she has paid for her
sin. And that is all she says except good-bye.”</p>

<p>He paused a moment, clearing his throat, and
when he went on he spoke aloud, but it was to
himself that he spoke rather than to the detective:
“Field of Honour? Not one but two out
of that family dead on the Field of Honour, by
my way of thinking. Yes, and though it’s a
new name for it, I guess you might call Fourteenth
Street and Third Avenue a Field of
Honour, too, and not be so very far wrong for
this once. What a hellish thing it all is!”</p>

<p>“How’s that, sir?” asked Schwartzmann.
“I didn’t quite get you.” He had taken the
two papers back in his own hands and was
shuffling them absently.</p>

<p>“Nothing,” said the magistrate. And then
almost harshly: “Well, what do you want me
to do about the woman in the pen yonder?”</p>

<p>“Well, sir,” said the other slowly, “I was
thinkin’ that probably you wouldn’t care to
tell her what’s just come off in the flat&mdash;at least
not in court. And I know I don’t want to
<a name="p089" id="p089"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>89<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>have to tell her. I thought maybe if you could
stretch the rules so’s I could get her out of
here without havin’ to make a regular charge
against her and without me havin’ to arraign
her in the regular <span class="nw">way&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>“Damn the rules!” snapped Voris petulantly.
“I’ll fix them. You needn’t worry about that
part of it. Go on!”</p>

<p>“Well, sir, I was thinkin’ maybe that after
I found somebody to take these letters back
where they belong, I could take her on home
with me&mdash;I live right down here in Greenwich
Village&mdash;and keep her there for the night, or
anyhow till the coroner’s physician is through
with what he’s got to do, and I’d ask my wife
to break the news to her and tell her about it.
A woman can do them things sometimes better’n
a man can. So that’s my idea, sir.”</p>

<p>“You’re willing to take a woman into your
home that you picked up for streetwalking?”</p>

<p>“I’ll take the chance. You see, Your Honour,
I seen somethin’ else&mdash;somethin’ I ain’t mentioned&mdash;somethin’
I don’t care to mention if
you don’t mind.”</p>

<p>“Suit yourself,” said the other. “I suppose
you’ll be looking up the newspaper men before
you go. This will make what they call a great
heart-interest story.”</p>

<p>“I don’t figure on tellin’ the reporters
neither,” mumbled Schwartzmann, as though
ashamed of his own forbearance.</p>

<p>The magistrate found the detective’s right
<a name="p090" id="p090"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>90<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>hand and started to shake it. Then he dropped it.
You might have thought from the haste with
which he dropped it that he also was ashamed.</p>

<p>“I’ll see you don’t get into any trouble with
the inspector,” he said. Then he added: “You
know of course that this brother was a French
soldier?”</p>

<p>“Sure I know it&mdash;you told me so.”</p>

<p>“You’re German, aren’t you?” asked Voris.
“German descent, I mean?”</p>

<p>“I don’t figure as that’s got anythin’ to do
with the case,” said the plain-clothes man,
bristling.</p>

<p>“I don’t either, Schwartzmann,” said the
magistrate. “Now you go ahead and get that
woman out of this hole.”</p>

<p>Schwartzmann went. She was where he had
left her; she was huddled up, shrinking in,
against the bars, and as he unlatched the iron
door and swung it in and beckoned to her to
come out from behind it, he saw, as she came,
that her eyes looked at him with a dumb, questioning
misery and that her left hand was still
gripped in a hard knot against her breast.
He knew what that hand held. It held a little,
cheap, carved white crucifix.</p>

<p class="tb"><br class="ns"
 />I see by the papers that those popularly reputed
to be anointed of God, who are principally
in charge of this war, are graciously
pleased to ordain that the same shall go on
for quite some time yet.</p>

 </span>CHAPTER III<br
 /><span class="so">THE SMART ALECK</span></h2>


<p class="newchap"><span class="dropcap ml6">Cap’n Buck Fluter</span>, holding his
watch in the approved conductor’s
grip, glanced back and forth the short
length of the four-five accommodation
and raised his free hand in warning:</p>

<p>“All aboard!”</p>

<p>From almost above his head it came:</p>

<p>“If you can’t get a board get a scantlin’!”</p>

<p>Clustered at the White or shady end of the
station, the sovereign Caucasians of Swango
rocked up against one another in the unbridled
excess of their merriment. Farther away, at the
Coloured or sunny end of the platform, the assembled
representatives of the African population
guffawed loudly, though respectfully. To
almost any one having the gift of spontaneous
repartee it might have occurred to suggest the
advisability of getting a plank provided you
could not get a board. It took Gash Tuttle to
think up scantling.</p>

<p>The humourist folded his elbows on the ledge
<a name="p092" id="p092"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>92<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>of the window and leaned his head and shoulders
out of the car, considering his people whimsically,
yet benignantly. He wore attire suitable
for travelling&mdash;a dented-in grey felt hat, adhering
perilously to the rearmost slope of his scalp;
a mail-order suit of light tan, with slashed
seams and rows of buttons extending up the
sleeves almost to the elbows; a hard-surfaced
tie of pale blue satin; a lavender shirt, agreeably
relieved by pink longitudinal stripings.</p>

<p>Except his eyes, which rather protruded, and
his front teeth, which undoubtedly projected,
all his features were in a state of active retreat&mdash;only,
his nose retreated one way and his chin
the other. The assurance of a popular idol who
knows no rival was in his pose and in his poise.
Alexander the Great had that look&mdash;if we may
credit the likenesses of him still extant&mdash;and
Napoleon Bonaparte had it, and David Garrick,
to quote a few conspicuous examples.</p>

<p>Alone, of all those within hearing, Cap’n Buck
Fluter did not laugh. Indeed, he did not even
grin.</p>

<p>“All right, black boy,” he said. “Let’s go
from here!”</p>

<p>The porter snatched up the wooden box that
rested on the earth, flung it on the car platform
and projected his person nimbly after it. Cap’n
Buck swung himself up the step with one hand
on the rail. The engine spat out a mouthful of
hot steam and the wheels began to turn.</p>

<p>“Good-by, my honeys, ’cause I’m gone!”
<a name="p093" id="p093"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>93<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>called out Mr. Tuttle, and he waved a fawn-coloured
arm in adieu to his courtiers, black and
white. “I’m a-goin’ many and a-many a mile
from you. Don’t take in no bad money while
your popper’s away.”</p>

<p>The station agent, in black calico sleeve-protectors
and celluloid eyeshade, stretched the
upper half of his body out the cubby-hole that
served him for an office.</p>

<p>“Oh, you Gash!” he called. “Give my love
to all the ladies.”</p>

<p>The two groups on the platform waited, all
expectant for the retort. Instantly it sped back
to them, above the clacking voice of the train:</p>

<p>“That’s all you ever would give ’em, ain’t
it?”</p>

<p>Mr. Gip Dismukes, who kept the livery stable,
slapped Mr. Gene Brothers, who drove the bus,
a resounding slap on the back.</p>

<p>“Ain’t he jest ez quick ez a flash?” he demanded
of the company generally.</p>

<p>The station agent withdrew himself inside his
sanctum, his sides heaving to his mirthful emotions.
He had drawn a fire acknowledged to be
deadly at any range, but he was satisfied. The
laugh was worth the wound.</p>

<p>Through the favoured section traversed by the
common carrier to whose care genius incarnate
had just committed his precious person there are
two kinds of towns&mdash;bus towns and non-bus
towns. A bus town lies at an appreciable distance
from the railroad, usually with a hill
<a name="p094" id="p094"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>94<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>intervening, and a bus, which is painted yellow, plies
between town and station. But a non-bus town
is a town that has for its civic equator the tracks
themselves. The station forms one angle of
the public square; and, within plain sight and
easy walking reach, the post office and at least
two general stores stand; and handily near by is
a one-story bank built of a stucco composition
purporting to represent granite, thus signifying
solidity and impregnability; and a two-story
hotel, white, with green blinds, and porches
running all the way across the front; also hitch
rails; a livery stable; and a Masonic Hall.</p>

<p>Swango belonged to the former category. It
was over the hill, a hot and dusty eighth of a
mile away. So, having watched the departing
four-five accommodation until it diminished to
a smudgy dot where the V of the rails melted
together and finally vanished, the assembled
Swangoans settled back in postures of ease to
wait for the up train due at three-eight, but
reported two hours and thirty minutes late.
There would still be ample time after it came
and went to get home for supper.</p>

<p>The contemptuous travelling man who once
said that only three things ever happened in
Swango&mdash;morning, afternoon and night&mdash;perpetrated
a libel, for he wilfully omitted mention
of three other daily events: the cannon-ball,
tearing through without stopping in the early
forenoon; the three-eight up; and the four-five
down.</p>

<p><a name="p095" id="p095"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>95<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span>So they sat and waited; but a spirit of depression,
almost of sadness, affected one and all. It
was as though a beaming light had gone out of
their lives. Ginger Marable, porter and runner
of the Mansard House, voiced the common
sentiment of both races as he lolled on a baggage
truck in the sunshine, with his cap of authority,
crowned by a lettered tin diadem, shoved far
back upon his woolly skull.</p>

<p>“Dat Mistah Gashney Tuttle he sho is a
quick ketcher,” stated Ginger with a soft
chuckle. “W’ite an’ black&mdash;we suttinly will
miss Mistah Tuttle twell he gits back home
ag’in.”</p>

<p>Borne away from his loyal subjects to the
pulsing accompaniment of the iron horse’s
snorted breath, the subject of this commentary
extended himself on his red plush seat and considered
his fellow travellers with a view to honing
his agile fancy on the whetstones of their duller
mentalities. On the whole, they promised but
poor sport. Immediately in front of him sat a
bride and groom, readily recognisable at a
glance for what they were&mdash;the bride in cream-coloured
cashmere, with many ribbons; the groom
in stiff black diagonals, with braided seams, and
a white lawn tie. A red-faced man who looked
as though he might be a deputy sheriff from
somewhere slept uneasily one seat in the rear.
He had his shoes off, revealing gray yarn socks.
His mouth was ajar, and down in his throat he
snored screechily, like a planing mill. The
<a name="p096" id="p096"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>96<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>youngest member of a family group occupying
two seats just across the aisle whimpered a
desire. Its mother rummaged in a shoebox
containing, among other delicacies, hard-boiled
eggs, salt and pepper mixed and enveloped in a
paper squill, blueberry pie, leaking profusely,
and watermelon-rind preserves, and found what
she sought&mdash;the lower half of a fried chicken leg.
Satisfied by this gift the infant ceased from fretful
repining, sucking contentedly at the meat
end; and between sucks hammered contentedly
with the drumstick on the seat back and window
ledge, leaving lardy smears there in the dust.</p>

<p>Cap’n Buck&mdash;captain by virtue of having a
regular passenger run&mdash;came through the car,
collecting tickets. At no time particularly long
on temper, he was decidedly short of it to-day.
He was fifteen minutes behind his schedule&mdash;no
unusual thing&mdash;but the locomotive was misbehaving.
Likewise a difference of opinion had
arisen over the proper identity of a holder of
mileage in the smoker. He halted alongside
Gash Tuttle, swaying on his legs to the roll and
pitch of the car floor.</p>

<p>“Tickets?” he demanded crisply.</p>

<p>“Wee gates, Cap,” answered the new passenger
jovially. “How does your copperosity seem
to sagashuate this evenin’?”</p>

<p>“Where goin’?” said Fluter, ignoring the
pleasantry. “I’m in a hurry. What station?”</p>

<p>“Well,” countered the irrepressible one,
“what stations have you got?”</p>

<p><a name="p097" id="p097"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>97<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span>Cap’n Buck Fluter’s cold eye turned meaningly
toward the bell cord, which dipped like
a tired clothesline overhead, and he snapped
two fingers peevishly.</p>

<p>“Son,” he said almost softly, “don’t monkey
with me. This here ain’t my day for
foolin’!”</p>

<p>Favoured son of the high gods though he was,
Gash Tuttle knew instantly now that this was
indeed no day for fooling. Cap’n Buck was not
a large man, but he had a way of growing to
meet and match emergencies. He handled the
Sunday excursions, which was the acid test of a
trainman’s grit. Coltish youths, alcoholically
keened up or just naturally high spirited, who
got on his train looking for trouble nearly always
got off looking for a doctor. As regards persons
wishful of stealing a ride, they never tried to
travel with Cap’n Buck Fluter oftener than
once. Frequently, for a period of time measurable
by days or weeks, they were in no fit state
to be travelling with any one except a trained
nurse.</p>

<p>Gash Tuttle quit his fooling. Without further
ado&mdash;whatever an ado is&mdash;he surrendered his
ticket, receiving in exchange a white slip with
punchmarks in it, to wear in his hatband. Next
came the train butcher bearing chewing gum,
purple plums in paper cornucopias, examples of
the light literature of the day, oranges which
were overgreen, and bananas which were overripe,
as is the way with a train butcher’s oranges
<a name="p098" id="p098"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>98<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>and bananas the continent over. In contrast
with the conductor’s dourness the train butcher’s
mood was congenially inclined to persiflage.</p>

<p>After an exchange of spirited repartee, at
which the train butcher by an admiring shake
of the head tacitly confessed himself worsted,
our hero purchased a paper-backed work entitled,
“The Jolly Old Drummer’s Private Joke
Book.” This volume, according to the whispered
confidences of the seller, contained tales of so
sprightly a character that even in sealed covers
it might be sent by mail only at the sender’s
peril; moreover, the wink which punctuated this
disclosure was in itself a promise of the spicy
entertainment to be derived from perusal thereof.
The price at present was but fifty cents;
later it would go up to a dollar a copy; this,
then, was a special and extraordinary rate.</p>

<p>The train continued on its course&mdash;not hurriedly,
but with reasonable steadfastness and
singleness of purpose. After much the same
fashion the sun went down. The bride repeatedly
whisked cindery deposits off her cashmered
lap; the large-faced man, being awakened by one
of his own snores, put on his shoes and indulged
in fine-cut tobacco, internally applied; but the
youngest passenger now slept all curled up in a
moist little bundle, showing an expanse of plump
neck much mottled by heat-rash, and clutching
in one greased and gritted fist the denuded
shank-bone of a chicken with a frieze of gnawed
tendons adhering to its larger joint.</p>

<p><a name="p099" id="p099"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>99<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span>At intervals the train stopped at small way
stations, bus or non-bus in character as the case
might be, to let somebody off or somebody on.
Cap’n Buck now made his trips carrying his
lantern&mdash;the ornate nickel-plated one that had
been awarded to him in the voting contest for
the most popular trainman at the annual fair
and bazaar of True Blue Lodge of the Junior
Order of American Mechanics. It had his proper
initials&mdash;J. J. F.&mdash;chased on its glass chimney
in old English script, very curlicue and ornamental.
He carried it in the crook of his left
elbow with the handle round his biceps; and
when he reached the end of his run he would
extinguish its flame, not by blowing it out but
by a quick, short, expert jerk of his arm. This
is a trick all conductors seek to acquire; some
of them succeed.</p>

<p>Twilight, the stage manager of night, had
stolen insidiously on the scene, shortening up
the backgrounds and blurring the perspectives;
and the principal character of this tale, straining
his eyes over the fine print, had reached the
next to the last page of “The Jolly Old Drummer’s
Private Joke Book” and was beginning to
wonder why the postal authorities should be so
finicky in such matters and in a dim way to wish
he had his fifty cents back, when with a glad
shriek of relief the locomotive, having bumped
over a succession of yard switches, drew up
under a long open shed alongside a dumpy brick
structure. To avoid any possible misunderstanding
<a name="p100" id="p100"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>100<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>this building was labelled Union Depot
in large letters and at both ends.</p>

<p>Being the terminus of the division, it was the
train’s destination and the destination of Mr.
Tuttle. He possessed himself of an imitation
leather handbag and descended on solid earth
with the assured manner of a seasoned and experienced
traveller. Doubtless because of the
flurry created by the train’s arrival and the
bustling about of other arrivals his advent
created no visible stir among the crowd at the
terminal. At least he noticed none. Still,
these people had no way of knowing who he
was.</p>

<p>In order to get the Union Depot closer to the
railroad it had been necessary to place it some
distance away from the heart of things; even so,
metropolitan evidences abounded. A Belt Line
trolley car stood stationary, awaiting passengers;
a vociferous row of negro hackmen were
kept in their proper places by a uniformed
policeman; and on the horizon to the westward
a yellow radiance glowed above an intervening
comb of spires and chimneys, showing where
the inhabitants of the third largest second-class
city in the state made merry at carnival and
street fair, to celebrate the dedication and opening
of their new Great White Way&mdash;a Great
White Way seven blocks long and spangled at
sixty-foot intervals with arc lights disposed in
pairs on ornamental iron standards. Hence
radiance.</p>

<p><a name="p101" id="p101"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>101<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span>Turning westward, therefore, Mr. Tuttle
found himself looking along a circumscribed
vista of one-story buildings with two-story
fronts&mdash;that is to say, each wooden front wall
extended up ten or fifteen feet above the peak
of the sloping roof behind it, so that, viewed
full-on, the building would have the appearance
of being a floor taller than it really was. To add
to the pleasing illusion certain of these superstructures
had windows painted elaborately on
their slab surfaces; but to one seeking a profile
view the false work betrayed a razor-like thinness,
as patently flat and artificial as stage
scenery.</p>

<p>Travellers from the Eastern seaboard have
been known to gibe at this transparent artifice.
Even New York flat dwellers, coming direct
from apartment houses which are all marble
foyers and gold-leaf elevator grilles below and
all dark cubby-holes and toy kitchens above,
have been known to gibe; which fact is here set
forth merely to prove that a sense of humour depends
largely on the point of view.</p>

<p>To our Mr. Tuttle such deceits were but a part
of the ordered architectural plan of things, and
they moved him not. What did interest him
was to note that the nearmost of these bogusly
exalted buildings displayed, above swinging
twin doors, a cluster of lights and a sign testifying
that this was the First Chance Saloon. Without
looking he sensed that the reverse of that
Janus-faced sign would advertise this same
<a name="p102" id="p102"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>102<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>establishment as being the Last Chance. He
did not know about Janus, but he did know
about saloons that are handily adjacent to union
depots. Moreover, an inner consciousness advised
him that after a dry sixty-mile trip he
thirsted amain. He took up his luggage and
crossed the road, and entered through the knee-high
swinging doors.</p>

<p>There was a bar and a bar mirror behind it.
The bar was decorated at intervals with rectangles
of fly paper, on the sticky surfaces of
which great numbers of flies were gummed fast
in a perished or perishing state; but before they
became martyrs to the fad of sanitation these
victims had left their footprints thickly on the
mirror and on the fringes of coloured tissue paper
that dangled from the ceiling. In a front corner,
against a window, was a lunch counter,
flanked on one side by stools and serving as a
barricade for an oil stove and shelves of cove
oysters in cans, and hams and cheeses for slicing,
and vinegar cruets and pepper casters and salt
cellars crusted with the saline deposits of the
years. A solitary patron was lounging against
the bar in earnest conversation with the barkeeper;
but the presiding official of the food-purveying
department must have been absent on
business or pleasure, for of him there was no sign.</p>

<p>Gash Tuttle ordered a beer. The barkeeper
filled a tall flagon with brew drawn from the
wood, wiped the clinging froth from its brim
with a spatulate tool of whittled cedar, and
<a name="p103" id="p103"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>103<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>placed the drink before the newcomer, who paid
for it out of a silver dollar. Even as Mr. Tuttle
scooped in his change and buried the lower part
of his face in the circumference of the schooner
he became aware that the other customer had
drawn nearer and was idly rattling a worn
leather cup, within which dice rapped against
the sides like little bony ghosts uneasy to escape
from their cabinet at a séance.</p>

<p>The manipulator of the dice held a palm
cupped over the mouth of the cup to prevent
their escape. He addressed the barkeeper:</p>

<p>“Flem,” he said, “you’re such a wisenheimer,
I’ll make you a proposition: I’ll shake three of
these here dice out, and no matter whut they
roll I’ll betcha I kin tell without lookin’ whut
the tops and bottoms will come to&mdash;whut the
spots’ll add up to.”</p>

<p>The other desisted from rinsing glassware in a
pail beneath the bar.</p>

<p>“Which is that?” he inquired sceptically.
“You kin tell beforehand whut the top and bottom
spots’ll add up?”</p>

<p>“Ary time and every time!”</p>

<p>“And let me roll ’em myself?”</p>

<p>“And let you roll ’em yourself&mdash;let anybody
roll ’em. I don’t need to touch ’em, even.”</p>

<p>“How much’ll you risk that you kin do that,
Fox?” Roused greed was in the speaker’s tone.</p>

<p>“Oh, make it fur the drinks,” said Fox&mdash;“jest
fur the drinks. I ain’t aimin’ to take your
money away frum you. I got all the money
<a name="p104" id="p104"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>104<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>I need.” For the first time he seemed to become
aware of a third party and he turned and
let a friendly hand fall on the stranger’s shoulder.
“Tell you whut, Flem, we’ll make it drinks fur
this gent too. Come on, brother,” he added;
“you’re in on this. It’s my party if I lose, which
I won’t, and ole Flem’s party if he loses, which
he shore will.”</p>

<p>It was the warmth of his manner as much as
the generosity of his invitation that charmed
Mr. Tuttle. The very smile of this man Fox
invited friendship; for it was a broad smile, rich
in proteids and butterfats. Likewise his personality
was as attractively cordial as his attire
was striking and opulent.</p>

<p>“‘Slide or slip, let ’er rip!’” said Mr. Tuttle,
quoting the poetic words of a philosopher of an
earlier day.</p>

<p>“That’s the talk!” said Fox genially. He
pushed the dice box across the bar. “Go to it,
bo! Roll them bones! The figure is twenty-one!”</p>

<p>From the five cubes in the cup the barkeeper
eliminated two. He agitated the receptacle
violently and then flirted out the three survivors
on the wood. They jostled and crocked against
one another, rolled over and stopped. Their
uppermost faces showed an ace, a six and a five.</p>

<p>“Twelve!” said Flem.</p>

<p>“Twelve it is,” echoed Fox.</p>

<p>“A dozen raw,” confirmed Gash Tuttle, now
thoroughly in the spirit of it.</p>

<p><a name="p105" id="p105"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>105<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span>“All right, then,” said Fox, flashing a beam
of admiration toward the humourist. “Now
turn ’em over, Flem&mdash;turn ’em over careful.”</p>

<p>Flem obeyed, displaying an ace, a deuce and
a six.</p>

<p>“And nine more makes twenty-one in all!”
chortled Fox triumphantly.</p>

<p>As though dazed, the barkeeper shook his
head.</p>

<p>“Well, Foxey, ole pardner, you shore got me
that time,” he confessed begrudgingly. “Whut’ll
it be, gents? Here, I reckin the cigars is on me
too, after that.” From a glass-topped case at
the end of the bar alongside Gash Tuttle he
produced a full box and extended it hospitably.
“The smokes is on the house&mdash;dip in, gents.
Dip in. Try an Old Hickory; them’s pure
Tampas&mdash;ten cents straight.”</p>

<p>He drew the beers&mdash;large ones for the two, a
small one for himself&mdash;and raised his own glass
to them.</p>

<p>“Here’s to you and t’ward you!” he said.</p>

<p>“Ef I hadn’t a-met you I wouldn’t a-knowed
you,” shot back Gash Tuttle with the lightning
spontaneity of one whose wit moves in boltlike
brilliancy; and at that they both laughed loudly
and, as though dazzled by his flashes, bestowed
on him the look that is ever the sweetest tribute
to the jester’s talents.</p>

<p>The toast to a better acquaintance being
quaffed and lights exchanged, the still nonplussed
Flem addressed the winners:</p>

<p><a name="p106" id="p106"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>106<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span>“Well, boys, I thought I knowed all there was
to know about dice&mdash;poker dice and crap dice
too; but live and learn, as the feller says. Say,
Fox, put me on to that trick&mdash;it’ll come in
handy. I’ll ketch Joe on it when he gits back,”
and he nodded toward the lunch counter.</p>

<p>“You don’t need to know no more’n you know
about it already,” expounded Fox. “It’s bound
to come out that way.”</p>

<p>“How is it bound to come out that way?”</p>

<p>“Why, Flem, it’s jest plain arithmetic; mathematics&mdash;that’s
all. Always the tops and bottoms
of ary<!-- sic: dialect for 'any' --> three dice come to twenty-one.
Here, gimme that cup and I’ll prove it.”</p>

<p>In rapid succession, three times, he shook
the cubes out. It was indeed as the wizard had
said. No matter what the sequence, the complete
tally was ever the same&mdash;twenty-one.</p>

<p>“Now who’d ’a’ thought it!” exclaimed Flem
delightedly. “Say, a feller could win a pile of
dough workin’ that trick! I’d ’a’ fell fur some
real money myself.”</p>

<p>“That’s why I made it fur the drinks,” said
the magnanimous Fox. “I wouldn’t put it over
on a friend&mdash;not for no amount; because it’s a
sure-thing proposition. It jest naturally can’t
lose! I wouldn’t ’a’ tried to skin this pardner
here with it even if I’d ’a’ thought I could.” And
once more his hand fell in flattering camaraderie
on a fawn-coloured shoulder. “I know a regular
guy that’s likewise a wise guy as soon as I see
him. But with rank strangers it’d be plumb
<a name="p107" id="p107"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>107<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>different. The way I look at it, a stranger’s
money is anybody’s <span class="nw">money&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>He broke off abruptly as the doorhinges
creaked. A tall, thin individual wearing a cap,
a squint and a cigarette, all on the same side of
his head, had entered. He stopped at the
lunch counter as though desirous of purchasing
food.</p>

<p>“Sh-h! Listen!” Fox’s subdued tones reached
only the barkeeper and Mr. Tuttle. “That
feller looks like a mark to me. D’ye know him,
Flem?”</p>

<p>“Never seen him before,” whispered back
Flem after a covert scrutiny of the latest arrival.</p>

<p>“Fine!” commented Fox, speaking with
rapidity, but still with low-toned caution. “Jest
to test it, let’s see if that sucker’ll fall. Here”&mdash;he
shoved the dice cup into Gash Turtle’s
grasp&mdash;“you be playin’ with the bones, sorter
careless. You kin have the first bet, because
I’ve already took a likin’ to you. Then, if he’s
willin’ to go a second time, I’ll take him on fur
a few simoleons.” The arch plotter fell into an
attitude of elaborate indifference. “Go ahead,
Flem; you toll him in.”</p>

<p>Given a guarantee of winning, and who among
us is not a born gamester? Gash Tuttle’s cheeks
flushed with sporting blood as he grabbed for the
cup. All his corpuscles turned to red and white
chips&mdash;red ones mostly. As for the barkeeper,
he beyond doubt had the making of a born conspirator
in him. He took the cue instantly.</p>

<p><a name="p108" id="p108"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>108<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span>“Sorry, friend,” he called out, “but the grub
works is closed down temporary. Anything I
kin do fur you?”</p>

<p>“Well,” said the stranger, edging over, “I
did want a fried-aig sandwich, but I might
change my mind. Got any cold lager on
tap?”</p>

<p>“Join us,” invited Fox; “we’re jest fixin’ to
have one. Make it beer all round,” he ordered
the barkeeper without waiting for the newcomer’s
answer.</p>

<p>Beer all round it was. Gash Tuttle, too eager
for gore to more than sip his, toyed with the
dice, rolling them out and scooping them up
again.</p>

<p>“Want to shake for the next round, anybody?”
innocently inquired the squint-eyed
person, observing this byplay.</p>

<p>“The next round’s on the house,” announced
Flem, obeying a wink of almost audible emphasis
from Fox.</p>

<p>“This here gent thinks he’s some hand with
the bones,” explained Fox, addressing the
stranger and flirting a thumb toward Gash
Tuttle. “He was sayin’ jest as you come in the
door yonder that he could let anybody else roll
three dice, and then he could tell, without lookin’
even, whut the tops and bottoms would add up
to?”</p>

<p>“Huh?” grunted the squinty-eyed man.
“Has he got any money in his clothes that says
he kin do that? Where I come frum, money
<a name="p109" id="p109"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>109<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>talks.” He eyed Gash Tuttle truculently, as
though daring him to be game.</p>

<p>“My money talks too!” said Mr. Tuttle with
nervous alacrity. He felt in an inner vest
pocket, producing a modest packet of bills.
All eyes were focused on it.</p>

<p>“That’s the stuff!” said Fox with mounting
enthusiasm. “How much are you two gents
goin’ to bet one another? Make it fur real
money&mdash;that is, if you’re both game!”</p>

<p>“If he don’t touch the dice at all I’ll bet him
fur his whole roll,” said the impetuous newcomer.</p>

<p>“That’s fair enough, I reckin,” said Fox.
“Tell you whut&mdash;to make it absolutely fair I’ll
turn the dice over myself and Flem’ll hold the
stakes. Then there can’t be no kick comin’
from nobody whatsoever, kin there?” He faced
their prospective prey. “How strong are you?”
he demanded, almost sneeringly. “How much
are you willin’ to put up against my pardner
here?”</p>

<p>“Any amount! Any amount!” snapped back
the other, squinting past Fox at Gash Tuttle’s
roll until one eye was a button and the other a
buttonhole. “Twenty-five&mdash;thirty&mdash;thirty-five&mdash;as
much as forty dollars. That’s how game
I am.”</p>

<p>Avarice gnawed at the taproots of Gash Tuttle’s
being, but caution raised a warning hand.
Fifteen was half of what he had and thirty was
all. Besides, why risk all on the first wager,
<a name="p110" id="p110"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>110<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>even though there was no real risk? A person
so impulsively sportive as this victim would
make a second bet doubtlessly. He ignored the
stealthy little kick his principal accomplice
dealt him on the shin. “I’ll make it fur fifteen,”
he said, licking his lips.</p>

<p>“If that’s as fur as you kin go, all right,” said
the slit-eyed man, promptly posting his money
in the outstretched hand of the barkeeper, who
in the same motion took over a like amount
from the slightly trembling fingers of the challenger.</p>

<p>Squint-eye picked up the dice cup and rattled
its occupants.</p>

<p>“Come on now!” he bantered Gash Tuttle.
“Whut’ll they add up, tops and bottoms?”</p>

<p>“Twenty-one!” said Mr. Tuttle.</p>

<p>“Out they come, then!”</p>

<p>And out they did come, dancing together,
tumbling and somersaulting, and finally halting&mdash;a
deuce, a trey and a four.</p>

<p>“Three and two is five and four is nine,” Gash
Tuttle read off the pips. “Now turn ’em over!”
he bade Fox. “That’s your job&mdash;turn ’em
over!” He was all tremulous and quivery inside.</p>

<p>In silence Fox drew the nearest die toward
him and slowly capsized it. “Four,” he announced.</p>

<p>He flipped the deuce end for end, revealing
its bottom: “Five!”</p>

<p>He reached for the remaining die&mdash;the four-spot.
Dragging it toward him, his large fingers
<a name="p111" id="p111"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>111<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>encompassed it for one fleeting instance, hiding
it from view entirely; then he raised his hand:
“Six!”</p>

<p>“Makin’ twenty-one in all,” stuttered Gash
Tuttle. He reached for the stakes.</p>

<p>“Nix on that quick stuff!” yelled his opponent,
and dashed his hand aside. “The tops
come to nine and the bottoms to fifteen&mdash;that’s
twenty-four, the way I figger. You lose!” He
pouched the money gleefully.</p>

<p>Stunned, Gash Tuttle contemplated the upturned
facets of the three dice. It was true&mdash;it
was all too true! Consternation, or a fine
imitation of that emotion, filled the countenances
of Flem and of Fox.</p>

<p>“That’s the first time I ever seen that happen,”
Fox whispered in the loser’s ear. “Bet
him again&mdash;bet high&mdash;and git it all back. That’s
the ticket!”</p>

<p>Mr. Tuttle shook his head miserably, but
stubbornly. For this once, in the presence of
crushing disaster, the divine powers of retort
failed him. He didn’t speak&mdash;he couldn’t!</p>

<p>“Piker money! Piker money!” chanted the
winner. “Still, ever’ little bit helps&mdash;eh,
boys?”</p>

<p>And then and there, before Gash Tuttle’s bulging
and horrified eyes, he split up the winnings in
the proportion of five for Flem and five for Fox
and five for himself. Of a sudden the loser was
shouldered out of the group. He looked not
into friendly faces, but at contemptuous backs
<a name="p112" id="p112"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>112<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>and heaving shoulders. The need for play acting
being over, the play actors took their ease
and divided their pay. The mask was off.
Treachery stood naked and unashamed.</p>

<p>Reaching blindly for his valise, Gash Tuttle
stumbled for the door, a load lying on his
daunted spirit as heavy as a stone. Flem hailed
him.</p>

<p>“Say, hold on!” He spoke kindly. “Ain’t
that your quarter yonder?”</p>

<p>He pointed to a coin visible against the flat
glass cover of the cigar case.</p>

<p>“Sure it is&mdash;it’s yourn. I seen you leave it
there when I give you the change out of that
dollar and purposed to tell you ’bout it at the
time, but it slipped my mind. Go on and pick
it up&mdash;it’s yourn. You’re welcome to it if you
take it now!”</p>

<p>Automatically Gash Tuttle reached for the
quarter&mdash;small salvage from a great and overwhelming
loss. His nails scraped the glass,
touching only glass. The quarter was cunningly
glued to its underside. Surely this place was
full of pitfalls. A guffawed chorus of derision
rudely smote his burning ears.</p>

<p>“On your way, sucker! On your way!”
gibed the perfidious Fox, swinging about with
his elbows braced against the bar and a five-dollar
bill held with a touch of cruel jauntiness
between two fingers.</p>

<p>“Whut you got in the gripsack&mdash;hay samples
or punkins?” jeered the exultant Slit-Eye.</p>

<p><a name="p113" id="p113"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>113<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span>“Yes; whut is the valise fur?” came Flem’s
parting taunt.</p>

<p>Under their goadings his spirit rallied.</p>

<p>“Cat’s fur, to make kittens’ britches!” he
said. Then, as a final shot: “You fellers needn’t
think you’re so derned smart&mdash;I know jest
exactly how you done it!”</p>

<p>He left them to chew on that. The parting
honours were his, he felt, but the spoils of war&mdash;alas!&mdash;remained
in the camp of the enemy.
Scarcely twenty minutes at the outside had
elapsed since his advent into city life, and
already one-half of the hoarded capital he had
meant should sustain him for a whole gala week
was irretrievably gone, leaving behind an emptiness,
a void as it were, which ached like the
socket of a newly drawn tooth.</p>

<p>Vague, formless thoughts of reprisal, of vengeance
exacted an hundredfold when opportunity
should fitly offer, flitted through his
numbed brain. Meantime though adventure
beckoned; half a mile away or less a Great White
Way and a street fair awaited his coming. That
saffron flare against the sky yonder was an invitation
and a promise. Sighing, he shifted his
valise from one hand to the other.</p>

<p>The Belt Line car, returning stationward, bore
him with small loss of time straightway to the
very centre of excitement; to where bunting
waved on store fronts and flag standards swayed
from trolley poles, converting the County
Square into a Court of Honour, and a myriad
<a name="p114" id="p114"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>114<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>lights glowed golden russet through the haze of
dust kicked up by the hurrying feet of merrymaking
thousands. Barkers barked and brass
bands brayed; strange cries of man and beast
arose, and crowds eddied to and fro like windblown
leaves in a gusty November. And all
was gaiety and abandon. From the confusion
certain sounds detached themselves, becoming
intelligible to the human understanding. As
for example:</p>

<p>“Remembah, good people, the cool of the
evenin’ is the time to view the edgycated
ostritch and mark his many peculiarities!”</p>

<p>And this:</p>

<p>“The big red hots! The g-e-r-reat big, juicy,
sizzlin’ red hots! The eriginal hot-dog sand-wige&mdash;fi’
cents, halluf a dime, the twentieth
part of a dollah! Here y’are! Here y’are! The
genuwine Mexican hairless Frankfurter fer fi’
cents!”</p>

<p>And this:</p>

<p>“Cornfetti! Cornfetti! All the colours of the
rainbow! All the pleasures of the Maudie Graw!
A large full sack for a nickel! Buy cornfetti and
enjoy yourselves.”</p>

<p>And so on and so forth.</p>

<p>The forlorn youth, a half-fledged school-teacher
from a back district, who had purchased
the county rights of a patent razor sharpener
from a polished gentleman who had had to look
at the map before he even knew the name of the
county, stood on a dry-goods box at the corner
<a name="p115" id="p115"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>115<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>of Jefferson and Yazoo, dimly regretful of the
good money paid out for license and unsalable
stock, striving desperately to remember and
enunciate the patter taught him by the gifted
promoter. For the twentieth time he lifted his
voice, essaying his word-formula in husky and
stuttering accents for the benefit of swirling
multitudes, who never stopped to listen:</p>

<p>“Friends, I have here the Infallible Patent
Razor Sharpener. ’Twill sharpen razors, knives,
scissors, scythe blades or any edged tool. If you
don’t believe it <span class="nw">will&mdash;&mdash;</span>” He paused, forgetting
the tag line; then cleared his throat and improvised
a finish: “If you don’t believe it will&mdash;why,
it will!” It was a lame conclusion and
fruitful of no sales.</p>

<p>How different the case with a talented professional
stationed half a block down the street,
who nonchalantly coiled and whirled and threw
a lasso at nothing; then gathered in the rope and
coiled and threw it again, always at nothing at
all, until an audience collected, being drawn by a
desire to know the meaning of a performance
seemingly so purposeless. Then, dropping the
rope, he burst into a stirring panegyric touching
on the miraculous qualifications of the Ajax
Matchless Cleaning and Washing Powder, which
made bathing a sheer pleasure and household
drudgery a joy.</p>

<p>Never for one moment abating the flow of his
eloquence, this person produced a tiny vial, held
it aloft, uncorked it, shook twenty drops of its
<a name="p116" id="p116"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>116<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>colourless fluid contents on the corrugated surface
of a seemingly new and virgin sponge; then
gently kneaded and massaged the sponge until&mdash;lo
and behold!&mdash;lather formed and grew and
mounted and foamed, so that the yellow lump
became a mass of creamy white suds the size of
a peck measure, and from it dripped huge bubbles
that foamed about his feet and expired
prismatically, as the dolphin was once believed
to expire, leaving smears upon the boards whereon
the operator stood.</p>

<p>Thereat dimes flowed in on him in clinking
streams, and bottles of the Matchless flowed
from him until, apparently grown weary of commerce,
he abandoned his perch, avowedly for
refreshment, but really&mdash;this being a trade
secret&mdash;to rub shavings of soft yellow soap into
the receptive pores of a fresh sponge and so
make it ready against the next demonstration.</p>

<p>Through such scenes Gash Tuttle wandered, a
soul apart. He was of the carnival, but not in it&mdash;not
as yet. With a pained mental jolt he
observed that about him men of his own age
wore garments of a novel and fascinating cut.
By contrast his own wardrobe seemed suddenly
grown commonplace and prosaic; also, these city
dwellers spoke a tongue that, though lacking,
as he inwardly conceded, in the ready pungency
of his own speech, nevertheless had a saucy and
attractive savour of novelty in its phrasing. Indeed,
he felt lonely. So must a troubadour of
old have felt when set adrift in an alien and
<a name="p117" id="p117"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>117<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>hostile land. So must the shining steel feel when
separated from the flint on which it strikes forth
its sparks of fire. I take it a steel never really
craves for its flint until it parts from it.</p>

<p>As he wormed through a group of roistering
youth of both sexes he tripped over his own
valise; a wadded handful of confetti struck him
full in the cheek and from behind him came a
gurgle of laughter. It was borne in on him that
he was the object of mirth and not its creator.
His neck burned. Certainly the most distressing
situation which may beset a humourist follows
hard on the suspicion that folks are laughing&mdash;not
with him, but at him!</p>

<p>He hurried on as rapidly as one might hurry
in such crowded ways. He was aware now of a
sensation of emptiness which could not be
attributed altogether to the depression occasioned
by his experience at the First and Last
Chance Saloon; and he took steps to stay it.
He purchased and partook of hamburger sandwiches
rich in chopped onions.</p>

<p>Later it would be time to find suitable lodgings.
The more alluring of the pay-as-you-enter
attractions were yet to be tested. By way of a
beginning he handed over a ten-cent piece to a
swarthy person behind a blue pedestal, and
mounting eight wooden steps to a platform he
passed behind a flapping canvas curtain. There,
in company with perhaps a dozen other patrons,
he leaned over a wooden rail and gazed downward
into a shallow tarpaulin-lined den where a
<a name="p118" id="p118"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>118<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>rather drowsy-appearing, half-nude individual,
evidently of Ethiopian antecedents, first toyed
with some equally drowsy specimens of the reptile
kingdom and then partook sparingly and
with no particular avidity of the tail of a very
small garter snake.</p>

<p>Chance, purely, had led Gash Tuttle to select
the establishment of Osay rather than that of
the Educated Ostrich, or the Amphibious Man,
or Fatima the Pearl of the Harem, for his first
plunge into carnival pleasures; but chance is the
hinge on which many moving events swing. It
was so in this instance.</p>

<p>Osay had finished a light but apparently satisfying
meal and the audience was tailing away
when Gash Tuttle, who happened to be the
rearmost of the departing patrons, felt a detaining
touch on his arm. He turned to confront a
man in his shirtsleeves&mdash;a large man with a
pock-marked face, a drooping moustache and a
tiger-claw watch charm on his vest. It was the
same man who, but a minute before, had delivered
a short yet flattering discourse touching the
early life and manners and habits of the consumer
of serpents&mdash;in short, the manager of
the show and presumably its owner.</p>

<p>“Say!” began this gentleman.</p>

<p>“Say yourself,” flashed Gash, feeling himself
on safe ground once more; “your mouth’s open.”</p>

<p>The man grinned in appreciation of the thrust&mdash;a
wincing grin, as though owning himself
beaten in the very first sally.</p>

<p><a name="p119" id="p119"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>119<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span>“All right, old scout,” he said jovially, “I
will. Come back here where nobody can’t hear
me while I say it.” He drew the younger man
to the inner side of the platform and sank his
voice to a confidential rumble. “Soon as I seen
you comin’ in I says to myself, ‘That’s the party
I’m lookin’ for.’ You don’t live here in this
town, do you?”</p>

<p>Gash Tuttle shook his head and started to
speak, but the big man was going on. Plainly he
was not one to waste time in idle preliminaries:</p>

<p>“That’s the way I doped it. You’re in the
profesh, ain’t you? You’ve been workin’ this
street-fair game somewhere, ain’t you?”</p>

<p>“No,” Gash Tuttle confessed, yet somehow
at the same time feeling flattered.</p>

<p>“Well, that just goes to show how a guy can
be fooled,” said the Osay man. “I’d ’a’ swore
you was on to all the ropes in this biz. Anyway,
I know just by the cut of your jib you’re the
party I’m lookin’ for. That’s why I braced you.
My name’s Fornaro; this here is my outfit. I
want somebody to throw in with me&mdash;and I’ve
made up my mind you’re the party I’m lookin’
for.”</p>

<p>Once bitten, twice shy; and Gash Tuttle’s
fifteen-dollar bite was still raw and bleeding.
He started to pull away.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t choose to invest in anything
more until I’d looked it over,” he began. The
large man grasped him by his two lapels and
<a name="p120" id="p120"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>120<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>broke in on him, drowning out the protest before
it was well started.</p>

<p>“Who said anything about anybody investin’
anything?” he demanded. “Did I? No. Then
listen to me a minute&mdash;just one minute. I’m
in a hurry my own self and I gotta hand you this
proposition out fast.”</p>

<p>Sincerity was in his tone; was in his manner
too. Even as he spoke his gaze roved past Gash
Tuttle toward the tarpaulin draperies which
contributed to their privacy, and he sweat
freely; a suetlike dew spangled his brow. There
was a noise outside. He listened intently, then
fixed a mesmerising stare on Gash Tuttle and
spoke with great rapidity and greater earnestness:</p>

<p>“You see, I got some other interests here.
Besides this pit show, I’m a partner in a store
pitch and a mitt-joint; and, what with everything,
I’m overworked. That’s the God’s truth&mdash;I’m
overworked! What I need is a manager
here. And soon as I seen how you handled
yourself I says to myself, ‘That’s the party I
want to hire for manager.’ What did you say
your name was?”</p>

<p>“Tuttle&mdash;Gashney P. <span class="nw">Tut&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>“That’s enough&mdash;the Tuttle part will do for
me. Now, Tuttle, set down that there keister
of yours&mdash;that gripsack&mdash;and listen. I gotta
go down the street for a half hour&mdash;maybe an
hour&mdash;and I want you to take charge. You’re
manager while I’m gone&mdash;the joint is yours till
I git back. And to-night, later on, we’ll fix up
<a name="p121" id="p121"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>121<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>a deal together. If you think you like the job
we’ll make a reg’lar arrangement; we’ll make it
permanent instid of temporary. See?”</p>

<p>“But&mdash;<span class="nw">but&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>“But nothin’! I want to find out if my first
judgment about you is correct. See? I want to
make a test. See? That’s it&mdash;a test. You ain’t
goin’ to have much to do, first off. The nigger
is all right s’long as he gits his dope.” He motioned
toward the canvas-lined retreat where
Osay now dozed heavily among the coils of his
somnolent pets. “And Crummy&mdash;that’s my
outside man&mdash;kin handle the front and make
the spiel, and take in what money comes in. I’ll
mention to him as I’m leavin’ that you’re in
charge. Probably I’ll be back before time for
the next blow-off. All you gotta do is just be
manager&mdash;that’s all; and if anybody comes
round askin’ for the manager, you’re him. See?”</p>

<p>His impetuosity was hypnotising&mdash;it was
converting; nay, compelling. It was enough
to sweep any audience off its feet, let alone an
audience of one. Besides, where lives the male
adult between the ages of nine and ninety who
in his own mind is not convinced that he has
within him the making of a great and successful
amusement purveyor? Still, Gash Tuttle hesitated.
The prospect was alluring, but it was
sudden&mdash;so sudden.</p>

<p>As though divining his mental processes, the
man Fornaro added a clinching and a convincing
argument.</p>

<p><a name="p122" id="p122"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>122<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span>“To prove I’m on the dead level with you,
I’m goin’ to pay you for your time&mdash;pay you
now, in advance&mdash;to bind the bargain until we
git the details all fixed up.” He hauled out a
fair-sized wad of currency and from the mass
detached a frayed green bill. “I’m goin’ to
slip you a she-note on the spot.”</p>

<p>“A which?”</p>

<p>“A she-note&mdash;two bones. See?”</p>

<p>He forced the money into the other’s palm.
As Gash Tuttle automatically pocketed the
retainer he became aware that this brisk new
associate of his, without waiting for any further
token of agreement on his part, already was
preparing to surrender the enterprise into his
keeping. Fornaro backed away from him and
dropped nimbly down off the back of the platform
where there was a slit in the canvas wall;
then turned and, standing on tiptoe to bring his
mouth above the level of the planking, spoke
the parting admonition in hasty tones:</p>

<p>“Remember now, you’re the boss, the main
guy, the whole cheese! If anybody asts you tell
’em you’re the manager and stick to it.”</p>

<p>The canvas flapped behind him and he was
gone. And Gash Tuttle, filled with conflicting
emotions in which reawakened pride predominated,
stood alone in his new-found kingdom.</p>

<p>Not for long was he alone, however. To be
exact, not for more than half a minute at the
very most. He heard what he might have
heard before had his ears been as keenly
<a name="p123" id="p123"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>123<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>attuned as the vanished Fornaro’s were. He
heard, just outside, voices lifted conflictingly in
demand, in expostulation, in profane protest
and equally profane denunciation of something
or other. A voice which seemed to be that of
the swarthy man denominated as Crummy gave
utterance to a howl, then instantly dimmed out,
as though its owner was moving or being moved
from the immediate vicinity with unseemly celerity
and despatch. Feet drummed on the wooden
steps beyond the draperies. Something heavy
overturned or was overthrown with a crash.</p>

<p>And as Mr. Tuttle, startled by these unseemly
demonstrations, started toward the front
entrance of his domain the curtain was yanked
violently aside and a living tidal wave flowed in
on him, dashing high and wide. On its crest,
propelled by irresistible cosmic forces, rode, as
it were, a slouch-hatted man with a nickel-plated
badge on his bosom, and at this person’s
side was a lanky countryman of a most threatening
demeanour; and behind them and beyond
them came a surging sea of faces&mdash;some hostile,
some curious, and all excited.</p>

<p>“Who’s in charge here?” shouted the be-badged
man.</p>

<p>“Me&mdash;I am,” began Gash Tuttle. “I’m the
manager. What’s wanted?”</p>

<p>“You are! I ’rest you in the name of the law
for runnin’ a skin game!” the constable whooped
gleefully&mdash;“on a warrant swore out less ’en a
hour ago.”</p>

<p><a name="p124" id="p124"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>124<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span>And with these astounding words he fixed his
fingers, grapple-hook fashion, in the collar of
the new manager’s coat; so that as Gash Tuttle,
obeying a primal impulse, tried to back away
from him, the back breadth of the coat bunched
forward over his head, giving him the appearance
of a fawn-coloured turtle trying to retreat
within its own shell. His arms, hampered by
sleeves pulled far down over the hands, winnowed
the air like saurian flippers, wagging in
vain resistance.</p>

<p>Holding him fast, ignoring his muffled and
inarticulate protests, the constable addressed
the menacing countryman:</p>

<p>“Is this here the one got your money?”</p>

<p>“No, ’tain’t. ’Twas a big ugly feller, with
mushtashes; but I reckin this here one must’ve
helped. Lemme search him.”</p>

<p>“Hands off the prisoner!” ordered the constable,
endeavouring to interpose his bulk between
maddened accuser and wriggling captive.</p>

<p>He spoke too late and moved too slowly. The
countryman’s gouging hands dived into Mr.
Tuttle’s various pockets and were speedily out
again in the open; and one of them held money
in it&mdash;paper and silver.</p>

<p>“Here ’tis!” barked the countryman, exultant
now. “This here two-dollar bill is mine&mdash;I
know it by this here red-ink mark.” He
shuffled out the three remaining bills and stared
at them a moment in stupefaction, and his yelp
<a name="p125" id="p125"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>125<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>of joy turned to a bellow of agonised berserk
rage. “I had two hundred and twenty-eight
dollars in cash, and here ain’t but seventeen
dollars and sixty cents! You derned sharper!
Where’s the rest of my mortgage money that
yore gang beat me out of?”</p>

<p>He swung a fearsome flail of an arm and full
in Gash Tuttle’s chest he landed a blow so well
aimed, so vigorous, that by its force the recipient
was driven backward out of his coat, leaving
the emptied garment in the constable’s clutches;
was driven still further back until he tottered
on the rear edge of the platform and tumbled
off into space, his body tearing away a width of
canvas wall and taking it along with him as he
disappeared.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was because he fell so hard that he
bounced up so instantaneously. He fought himself
free of the smothering folds of dusty tarpaulin
and turned to flee headlong into the darkness.
He took three flying steps and tripped
over the guy rope of the next tent. As he fell
with stunning violence into the protecting
shadows he heard pursuit roll over the platform
past Osay, thud on the earth, clatter on by him
and die away in the distance to the accompaniment
of cheers, whoops and the bloodthirsty
threats of the despoiled countryman.</p>


<p class="tb"><br class="ns"
 />If one has never stolen a ride on a freight
train the task presents difficulties and dangers.
Still, it may be done, provided one is sufficiently
<a name="p126" id="p126"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>126<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>hard pressed to dare its risks and risk its discomforts.
There is one especially disagreeable
feature incident to the experience&mdash;sooner or
later discovery is practically inevitable.</p>

<p>Discovery in this instance came just before
the dawn, as the freight lumbered through the
swampy bottoms of Obion Creek. A sleepy and
therefore irritable brakeman found, huddled up
on the floor of an empty furniture car, a dark
heap, which, on being stirred with a heavy boot-toe,
moved and moaned and gave forth various
other faint signs of life. So, as the locomotive
slowed down for the approach to the trestle, he
hoisted the unresisting object and with callous
unconcern shoved it out of the open car door on
to the sloping bank of the built-up right of way&mdash;all
this occurring at a point just beyond where
a white marker post gleamed spectrally in the
strengthening light of the young summer day,
bearing on its planed face the symbol, S-3&mdash;meaning
by that, three miles to Swango Junction.</p>

<p>At sunup, forty minutes later, a forlorn and
shrunken figure, shirt-sleeved, hatless and carrying
no baggage whatsoever, quit the crossties
and, turning to the left from the railroad track
some rods above the station, entered, with
weary gait, a byway leading over the hill to the
town beyond. There was a drooping in the
shoulders and a dragging of the mud-incrusted
legs, and the head, like Old Black Joe’s, was
bending low.</p>

<p><a name="p127" id="p127"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>127<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span>The lone pedestrian entered the confines of
Swango proper, seeking, even at that early hour,
such backways as seemed most likely to be
empty of human life. But as he lifted his leaden
feet past the Philpotts place, which was the
most outlying of local domiciles, luck would
have it that Mr. Abram Philpotts should be up
and stirring; in fact, Mr. Philpotts, being engaged
in the milk and butter business, was out
in his barn hitching a horse to a wagon. Chancing
to pass a window of the barn he glanced
out and saw a lolled head bobbing by above
the top of his back fence.</p>

<p>“Hey there!” he called out. “Hey, Gash,
what air you doin’ up so early in the mornin’?”</p>

<p>With a wan suggestion of the old familiar
sprightliness the answer came back, comically
evasive:</p>

<p>“That’s fur me to know and fur you to find
out!”</p>

<p>Overcome, Mr. Philpotts fell up against his
stable wall, feebly slapping himself on the legs
with both hands.</p>

<p>“Same old Gashney!” he gurgled. “They
can’t nobody ever git ahead of you, kin they
boy?”</p>

<p>The words and the intent of the tribute
reached beyond the palings. Their effect was
magical; for the ruler was in his realm again,
back among his loyal, worshipful subjects. The
bare head straightened; the wearied legs unkinked;
the crushed and bruised spirit revived.
<a name="p128" id="p128"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>128<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>And Gashney Tuttle, king of jesters, re-crowned,
proceeded jauntily on his homeward way, with
the wholesome plaudits of Mr. Philpotts ringing
in his gratified ears and the young sun shining,
golden, in his face.</p>

 </span>CHAPTER IV<br
 /><span class="so">BLACKER THAN SIN</span></h2>


<p class="newchap"><span class="dropcap ml6">It</span> was the year after the yellow fever that
Major Foxmaster moved out from Virginia;
that would make it the year 1876.
And the next year the woman came. For
Major Foxmaster her coming was inopportune.
It is possible that she so timed it with that
very thing in mind. To order her own plans
with a view to the upsetting and the disordering
of his plans may have been within the scope
of her general scheme. Through intent, perhaps,
she waited until he had established himself
here in his new environment, five hundred
miles from tidewater, before she followed
him.</p>

<p>Be this as it may, that was what happened.
The Major came out in the spring of the year.
He was pushing fifty then, a fine upstanding
figure of a man&mdash;what women, for lack of a
better name, call distinguished looking. He
had been a lieutenant in the Mexican War
and a major in the Civil War&mdash;on the
<a name="p130" id="p130"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>130<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>Confederate side, of course, seeing that he came from
the seaboard side and not from the mountainous
flank of Virginia.</p>

<p>You get some notion of what manner of man
he was when I tell you that in all the years he
lived in this city, which was a fair-sized city,
only one man ever called him by his first name.
Behind his back he was to others The Major,
sometimes The Old Major, and rarely Major;
but to his face people always hailed him, properly,
as Major Foxmaster. And, despite the
role he was to play in the community, he never
acquired a nickname; and that was not so
strange, either. You give nicknames to geysers,
but not to glaciers.</p>

<p>This man’s manner was icily formal toward
those he deemed his inferiors, icily polite toward
those whom he acknowledged his equals.
He had no code for his intercourse with superiors
because he never met anybody whom he
regarded as his social superior. He looked upon
the world with a bleak, chill eye, and to it he
showed a bleak, chill face. It was a mask
really&mdash;a mask of flesh held in such fine and
rigid control that it gave no hint, ever, of what
went on in the cool brain behind it. A professional
poker player would have traded five years
out of his life to be the owner of such a face.</p>

<p>Well, the Major came. He had money, he
had family, he had a military record; likewise
he had the poise and the pose which, lacking
all the other things, still would have given him
<a name="p131" id="p131"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>131<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>consideration and a place in town life. His
status in the financial world became fixed when
he deposited in the largest bank a drawing account
of such size as instantly to win the cuddling
admiration of the president of the bank.
He had established himself in rooms at the
Gaunt House&mdash;then, and for many years thereafter,
the principal hotel. Before fall he was
proposed for membership in the exclusive Kenilworth
Club, that was the unattainable Mecca
toward which many men turned wistful eyes.
Judge Sherwan, who was afterward to be his
only close friend, sponsored his candidacy and
he was elected promptly. Very soon his life
fell into the grooves that always thenceforward
it was to follow.</p>

<p>The Major did not go into any business.
Opportunities to go into this or that were in
due season presented to him. He listened with
his air of congealed courtesy, but declined them
all, explaining that his present investments
were entirely satisfactory and yielded him a
satisfactory income. Like many men of his
breed and generation, he liked a good horse so
well that it was more than a liking&mdash;with him
it was a love. Afternoons he frequently drove
one: a ramping bay mare with a fractious temper
and a set of gifted heels. He was fond of
cards, and in the evenings generally played
cards with certain of his fellow club members
in a private room at the Kenilworth Club.</p>

<p>These men, though, never became his friends,
<a name="p132" id="p132"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>132<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>but were merely the men with whom he played
cards. If of a morning after breakfast he went
for a walk, as sometimes happened, he went
alone, except on those infrequent occasions
when Judge Sherwan accompanied him. At the
beginning he was asked to affairs at the homes
of influential people; but, since he never accepted
these invitations&mdash;any of them&mdash;people
presently quit asking him. Among a hundred
thousand human beings he became, or rather
he remained, so far as interchange of thought,
or of affection, or of confidence, or of intimacy
was concerned, a social Crusoe upon a desert
island set in an empty sea, with no Man Friday
to bear him company in his loneliness&mdash;unless
it might be said that old Sherwan qualified,
after a fashion, for the Man-Friday job.</p>

<p>You see, the Major knew all along that&mdash;sooner
or later&mdash;the woman would be coming.
For these few months he had played the truant
from his destiny, or his Nemesis, or his fate,
or by whatever fancy name you might choose
to call it; but there was no chance of his having
escaped it altogether. Through strength of will
power he could in silence continue to endure
it as he had in silence endured it through the
years that stretched-backward between young-manhood
and middle age. Through pride he
would involve no other person, however remotely,
in the sorry web of his own weaving.
Mentally he manoeuvred to stand apart from
his kind; to render himself as inaccessible, as
<a name="p133" id="p133"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>133<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>aloof, as unknowable by them as the core of
an iceberg.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, it was inevitable that the channels
of his outer life, no matter how narrowly
they ran or how coldly they coursed, would be
disturbed and set awry by her coming. A cultivated
and well-sustained indifference to popular
opinion is all well enough, but gossip is a
corrosive that eats through the calluses until
it finds quick flesh underneath. The Major
might arm himself against showing what he
felt, but he could not armour himself against
feeling what he felt. He knew it&mdash;and she knew
it. Perhaps that was why she, this one time,
delayed her coming until he had ample opportunity
for becoming, in a measure, fixed in the
community and identified with it.</p>

<p>She came. One morning in the young spring
of the year following the year when this narrative
begins, Major Foxmaster stepped out from
between the tall pillars of the Gaunt House
doorway to find her waiting for him upon the
sidewalk. She stood close to the curbing, a
tall and straight figure, swathed all in dead
and dreary black, with black skirts hiding her
feet and trailing on the bricks behind her; with
black gloves upon her clasped hands; with a
long, thick veil of black crêpe hiding her face
and the shape of her head, and descending,
front and back, almost to her waist&mdash;a striking
figure and one to catch the eye.</p>

<p>After the first glance he gave no heed to her
<a name="p134" id="p134"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>134<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>at all, nor she to him&mdash;except that when he had
descended the short flight of stone steps and
set off down the street at his usual brisk, soldierly
gait, she followed, ten paces in his rear.
By reason of her skirts, which swept the ground
round her, and by reason, too, that her shoes
had soles of felt or of rubber, she seemed almost
to float along the pavement behind him, without
apparent effort&mdash;certainly without sound.</p>

<p>Two blocks down the street he entered a
business house. She waited outside, as silent
as a mute and as funereal as a pall. In a few
minutes he reappeared; she fell in behind him.
He crossed over to the other side; she crossed,
too, maintaining the distance between them.
Crossing, his heels hit hard upon the rutted
cobbles of the roadway; but she glided over
them noiselessly and smoothly, almost like one
who walked on water. He went into the Kenilworth
Club and for an hour or two sat in the
reading room behind a newspaper. Had he
raised his eyes he might have seen, through
the window, the woman waiting on the curb.
He ate his luncheon there in the club at a table
in a corner of the dining room, alone, as was
his way. It was two o’clock and after before
he left to go to the livery stable where he kept
his mare. She followed, to wait outside the
livery stable until he had driven away in his
gig, bound for the trotting track where the
city’s horse fanciers exercised their harness stock.</p>

<p>For a space, then, she disappeared. Having
<a name="p135" id="p135"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>135<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>returned the rig to its quarters and having
dined at the Gaunt House, the Major came
forth once more at eight-thirty o’clock to return
to the Kenilworth for a bout at the cards.
He was spruced and for the second time that
day he had shaved. Plainly his measured and
customary habit of life was to go on just as it
had gone on before the woman came&mdash;or,
rather, it might be said that it was only now
reassuming the routine which, with breaks in
between, it had pursued through so many years.
Major Foxmaster came down the steps, drawing
on his gloves. From the deeper darkness
beyond a patch of yellowish glow where a gas
lamppost stood the woman emerged, appearing
now as an uncertain, wavering shape in her
black swathings. Again she followed him, at a
distance of a few paces, to the Kenilworth Club;
again she waited in the shadows cast by its old-fashioned
portico while he played his game and,
at its end, cashed in his winnings&mdash;for the Major
won that night, as very often he did; again she
followed him homeward at midnight through
the silent and empty street. Without a word or
a sign or a backward glance he ascended the
steps and passed within the doors of the Gaunt
House. Without a word or a sign she lingered
until he had disappeared; then she turned off
the pavement into the road and vanished,
swimming away upright, as it were, without
visible motion of her limbs or her body, into
a stilled and waveless sea of darkness.</p>

<p><a name="p136" id="p136"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>136<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span>I have here set down the story of this day
with such detail because, with occasional small
variations, it was to be the story of an uncounted
number of other days coming after it.</p>

<p>Inside of twenty-four hours the whole city
knew the tale, and buzzed and hummed with
it. Inside of forty-eight hours the woman, by
common consent, had been given the names she
was ever thereafter to wear. She was, to some,
The Woman in Black; to others, Foxmaster’s
Shadow. Inside of a week or two the town was
to know, by word of mouth passed on from this
person to that, and by that person to another,
all that it was ever to know of her.</p>

<p>She came from the same place whence he
came&mdash;a small Virginia town somewhere near
the coast. As the current reports ran, the Foxmaster
plantation and the plantation of her
family adjoined; as children&mdash;remember, I am
still quoting the account that was generally
accepted&mdash;they had played together; as young
man and young woman they had been sweethearts.
He wronged her and then denied her
marriage. Her father was dead; she had no
brothers and no near male relatives to exact,
at the smaller end of a pistol, satisfaction from
the seducer. So she dedicated her days and
nights to the task of haunting him with the
constant reminder of his crime and her wrongs.
She clad herself in black, with a veil before her
face to hide it, as one in mourning for a dead
life; and she set herself to following him
<a name="p137" id="p137"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>137<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>wherever he might go. She never spoke to him;
she never, so far as the world at large knew,
wrote to him nor meddled in any fashion whatsoever
with him or his affairs&mdash;but she followed
him.</p>

<p>The war, coming on, broke for four years the
continuity of her implacable plan of vengeance.
When the war was over, and he came back home,
she took it up again. He left the town where he
had been reared and moved to Richmond, and
then after a time from Richmond to Baltimore;
in due season she followed after. Finally he
had moved to this more westerly city, lying on
the border between the North and the South.
And now here she was too.</p>

<p>Through an agent in Virginia she had leased,
ready furnished, the old Gresham place, diagonally
across the way from the front entrance
of the Gaunt House; that fact speedily came out,
proving that, like him, she also had means of
her own. Through this same agent the taxes
were thereafter paid. Presumably she moved
in under cover of night, for she was a figure
that, once seen, was not to be forgotten; and
most certainly no one could remember having
seen her before that fine spring morning when
Major Foxmaster came out of the Gaunt House
to find her waiting for him.</p>

<p>She had brought her servants with her&mdash;a
middle-aged mulatto man and his wife, a tall,
young, coal-black negro woman; both of them
as close-mouthed as only some negroes can be,
<a name="p138" id="p138"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>138<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>when they are the exceptions to prove the rule
of a garrulous race. The mulatto man was a
combination of butler and gardener. It was
he who did the marketing, dealing with the
tradespeople and paying all the bills. The
negro woman was the cook, presumably.
Passers-by rarely saw her. These two, with
their mistress, composed the household.</p>

<p>For such a mistress and such a household the
old Gresham place made a most fit abiding
place. It was one of those houses that seemed
builded for the breeding of mysteries and the
harbouring of tragedies&mdash;the kind of house that
cannot stand vacant long without vaguely acquiring
the reputation of being haunted. It
was a big, foursquare house of greyish stone,
placed in the exact centre of a narrow, treeless
lot, which extended through for the full depth
of the city block. In front of it was a high
picketed fence and a deep, bare grassplot; behind
it was a garden of sorts, with a few stunted
and illy-nourished berry bushes; and on each
side of it was a brick wall, so high that the sunshine
never fell on the earth at the side of the
house toward the north; and even in the hottest
summer weather the foundation stones there
were slick and sweaty with the damp, and big
snails crawled on the brick wall that ran in the
shadow of the wall, leaving trails of a luminous
slime across the slick greenish mould which covered
the bricks.</p>

<p>The woman took this house, with its gear
<a name="p139" id="p139"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>139<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>and garnishings, just as the last of the Greshams
had left it when he died. During the months
and years it remained tenantless all the upper
windows had been tightly shuttered; she left
them so. In the two lower front windows,
which flanked the deeply recessed front door
and which lacked blinds, were stiff, heavy
shades of a dull silver colour, drawn down until
only a glassed space of inches showed between
their unfringed ends and the stone copings.
These, too, were left as they had been. They
accorded well with the blank, cold house itself;
they matched in with its drear old face; they
made you think of coins on a dead man’s eyes.</p>

<p>This house, as I have said, stood almost opposite
the Gaunt House. What went on within
it no outsider ever knew, for no outsider ever
crossed its threshold&mdash;to this good day no outsider
ever has known; but every day its door
opened to let out its draped and veiled mistress,
setting forth on her business, which was to
follow Major Foxmaster; and every night,
when that day’s business was done, it opened
again to let her back in. In time the town grew
used to the sight; it never grew tired of talking
about it.</p>

<p>As for Major Foxmaster, he would dodge
about the country no more; for, in the long run
or the short, dodging availed him nothing.
The years behind him proved that. He would
bide where he was until death, which was the
supreme handicapper, named the winner of
<a name="p140" id="p140"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>140<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>this, the last heat of their strange match. He
would outlive her and be free; else she would
outlive him, to see her long-famished hatred
sated. And he wondered whether, if he died
first, she, in her black mourning, would dog his
dead body to the grave as she had dogged his
living steps! It was a morbid fancy and, perhaps
because it was morbid, it found a lodgment
in the Major’s mind, recurring to him again
and again. The existence that he&mdash;and she&mdash;had
willed him to lead was not conducive to an
entirely healthy mental aspect.</p>

<p>Whatever his thoughts were, he betrayed
none of them to the rest of creation. Exactly
as before she appeared, so he continued to deport
himself. His behaviour showed no change.
He took his walks, drove his bay filly, played
his cards at the Kenilworth. He carried his
head as high as ever; he snapped his military
heels down as firmly as ever on the stones of
the street and the bricks of the sidewalk. With
a pair of eyes that were as inscrutable and yet
as clear as two bits of hard blue ice, and with
a face like a square of chipped flint, he went his
daily and his hourly way, outwardly oblivious
to the stares of acquaintance and stranger
alike, seeming not to know that ten paces in
his rear, or twelve, came drifting this erect
veiled shape which was clad all in dead black&mdash;as
black as sin, as black as his sin had been,
as black as her misery had been&mdash;the incarnate
embodiment of her shame and his.</p>

<p><a name="p141" id="p141"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>141<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span>In fair weather as in foul, in blistering midsummer
and blizzardy midwinter, daytime and
nighttime, she followed him. If she lost the
trail she waited in all patience until he reappeared.
She seemed tireless and hungerless.
Wet or cold or heat seemed not to affect her.
In her grim pursuit of him her spirit rose triumphant
above the calls of the flesh. At midnight,
after a long vigil outside the Kenilworth,
she moved behind him with the same
swift, noiseless, floating motion that marked
her in the morning. And so it went with these
two.</p>

<p>If he did not notice her presence, neither did
he seek ever to elude her. If he never spoke
to her, neither did he speak of her to others.
As for the woman, she never spoke to any one
at all. Outside the walls of the house where she
lived her voice was never heard and her face
was never seen. Only one person ever dared
speak to the Major of her.</p>

<p>Old Sherwan himself did not dare. Of all
human beings he stood nearest to the Major.
If the Major might be said to have an intimate
Judge Sherwan was the one. Moreover, he,
Sherwan, was by way of being a he-gossip,
which of all the created breeds of gossips is the
most persistent and the most consistent, the
most prying and, therefore, the most dangerous.
He yearned for the smell of impropriety as
a drug-fiend yearns for his drug. His was a
brackish old soul and from its soured depths
<a name="p142" id="p142"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>142<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>he dearly loved to spew up the bilge waters
of scandal. The pumps leading to that fouled
hold were always in good order. Give him the
inch of fact and he would guarantee to provide
the ell of surmise and innuendo. Grown too
old to sin actually he craved to sin vicariously&mdash;to
balance always on the edge of indiscretion,
since he no longer plunged into it bodily.</p>

<p>Wherefore, after the woman came and the
first shock of her coming wore off, he made
a point of being seen in Major Foxmaster’s
company as much as possible. The share of
notoriety the association brought him was dear
to his withered, slack-valved old heart. In
his manner and his look, in the very way he
cocked his hat and waggled his stiffened legs,
you discerned that he wished to divide with
his friend the responsibility for the presence
of his friend’s trailing shadow.</p>

<p>But, for all this and all that, he did not dare
ever to speak of her to Major Foxmaster. Joel
Bosler dared to, though, he being one of the
meagre-minded breed proverbially reputed to
go rushing in where angels fear to tread. This
Joel Bosler was a policeman; his beat included
the Gaunt House corner and both sides of the
street upon which the Gaunt House fronted.
He was a kindly enough creature; a long slab-pole
of a man, with the face of an old buck
sheep. For some reason&mdash;which he least of all
could fathom&mdash;Joel Bosler had contracted a
vague sort of attachment for the Major. They
<a name="p143" id="p143"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>143<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>met occasionally on the sidewalk outside the
hotel; and, since the Major always responded
with iced and ceremonial politeness to the policeman’s
salute, it may have been that this,
to Bosler’s limited mind, was proof of a friendly
understanding existing between them.</p>

<p>One day, about a month after the woman
moved into the old Gresham place, Bosler,
having first scratched his head assiduously for
a space of minutes to stimulate the thought,
was moved to invade the Gaunt House lobby
and send his name upstairs to the Major’s
rooms. A negro bell boy brought word back
that the Major would be very glad to see
Policeman Bosler, and Policeman Bosler accordingly
went up. The Major was in the sitting
room of his suite of rooms on the second
floor. Bosler, bowing, came in and shut the
door behind him with an elaborate carefulness.</p>

<p>“Good morning, sir?” said Major Foxmaster
formally, with the note of polite interrogation
in his tone; and then, as Bosler stood fingering
his blue cap and shuffling his feet: “Well, sir;
well?”</p>

<p>“Major Foxmaster, suh,” began Bosler, “I&mdash;er&mdash;I
kinder wanted to say somethin’ to you
privatelike.”</p>

<p>He halted lamely. Before the daunting focus
of those frigid blue eyes his speech, carefully
rehearsed beforehand, was slipping away from
him.</p>

<p>“Except for ourselves, there is no one within
<a name="p144" id="p144"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>144<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>hearing,” stated the Major. “Kindly proceed&mdash;if
you will be so good.”</p>

<p>“Well, suh,” faltered Bosler, fumbling his
words out&mdash;“well, suh, Major Foxmaster, it’s
this-a-way: I’ve been&mdash;been a-thinkin’ it over;
and if this here lady&mdash;this woman that wears
black all the time&mdash;the one that’s moved into
the old Gresham place acrost the street&mdash;if she
pesters you any by follerin’ you round every
wheres, the way she does&mdash;I thought I’d be
very glad&mdash;if you said the word&mdash;to warn her
to quit it, else I’d&mdash;I’d have to take steps agin
her by law or somethin’. And so&mdash;and <span class="nw">so&mdash;&mdash;</span>”
He stopped altogether. He had been chilled
at the moment of his entrance; now he was
frozen mentally to below the zero point.</p>

<p>The Major spoke, and his syllables battered
on Joel Bosler’s unprotected head like hailstones.</p>

<p>“Have you ever observed that the person
to whom you refer has spoken to me?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“No, suh; <span class="nw">but&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>“Or ever molested me in any way?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, suh; but, you <span class="nw">see&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>“Have you ever observed that I spoke to
her?”</p>

<p>“No, suh; <span class="nw">but&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>“Have you any reason for believing, of your
own knowledge, that she knows me?”</p>

<p>“Well, suh, <span class="nw">I&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>“Or that I am acquainted with her?”</p>

<p><a name="p145" id="p145"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>145<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span>“Well, <span class="nw">I&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>“Then, sir, since she is minding her own
business and I am minding my own business,
I suggest that you take pattern by such examples
and cultivate the habit of minding
your own business. Kindly do not address
me hereafter upon this subject&mdash;or any other.
I find your conversation singularly unattractive.
Good day, sir!”</p>

<p>Policeman Joel Bosler had no recollection
afterward of having withdrawn himself. He
presently found himself downstairs in the
lobby, and, a little later on, outside the hotel,
upon his regular beat. How he got there or
how long it took him to get there he could not,
with any degree of certainty, say.</p>

<p>Presently, though, he saw the Major issue
forth from the Gaunt House door. And as
the Major’s foot descended upon the first step
of the flight leading down to the street level,
the gate of the old Gresham place across the
way clicked, and here came the cloaked, veiled
woman, floating noiselessly across the road to
follow him.</p>

<p>Joel Bosler, still in a state of intellectual
numbness, watched them as they passed down
the street&mdash;the Major striding on ahead, the
gliding woman ten paces behind him. He had
witnessed the same sight perhaps thirty times
before. In days to come he was to witness it
hundreds of times more; but always he watched
it and never grew weary of watching it. Nor
<a name="p146" id="p146"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>146<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>did the eyes of the rest of the town weary of
watching it.</p>

<p>And so the thing went on.</p>


<p class="tb"><br class="ns"
 />The years went by. Five of them went by.
Ten of them went by. A new generation was
growing up, coming into manhood and womanhood.
An old generation was thinning out
and dying off. The Gaunt House was no longer
the best hotel in the city. It was the second
best and, before very long, was to be the third
best. Tall business houses&mdash;six, seven, eight,
nine stories tall&mdash;shouldered up close to it; and
they dwarfed it, making it seem squatty and
insignificant, whereas before it had loomed
massive and monument-high, dominating the
corner and the rest of the block. Once the
cobbled road before its doors had clinked to
the heel-taps of smart carriage horses. Now it
thundered clamorously beneath the broad iron-shod
tires of dray and vans.</p>

<p>The old Gresham place, diagonally across
the way, looked much as it had always looked;
indeed, there was not much about it, exteriorly
speaking, to undergo change. Maybe the green
mould in the damp, slick walk at its northern
side was a little bit greener and a little bit
thicker; and maybe, in summer, the promenading
snails were a trifle more numerous there.
The iron gate, set in the middle breadth of the
iron fence, lolled inward upon one rusted
hinge, after the fashion of a broken wing. The
<a name="p147" id="p147"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>147<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>close-drawn shades in the two lower front windows
had faded from a tarnished silver colour
to a dulled leaden colour; and one of them&mdash;the
one on the right-hand side&mdash;had pulled away
and awry from its fastenings above and was
looped down, hanging at a skewed angle behind
the dirtied and crusted panes, as though one of
the coins had slipped halfway off the dead
man’s eyelids. People persistently called it the
old Gresham place, naming it so when they
pointed it out to strangers and told them the
tale of its veiled chatelaine and her earthly mission.</p>

<p>For, you know, Major Foxmaster’s shadow
still followed after Major Foxmaster. Long
before, these two had been accepted as verities;
it might now be said of them that they had
become institutional&mdash;inevitable fixtures, with
orbits permanent and assured in the swing of
community life. In the presence of this pair
some took a degree of pride, bragging when
away from home that they came from the town
where so strange a sight might forever be seen,
and when at home bringing visitors and chance
acquaintances to this corner of the town in
order to show it to these others.</p>

<p>Along with this morbid pride in a living
tragedy ran a sort of undercurrent of sympathy
for its actors. From the beginning there
had been pity for the woman who, the better
everlastingly to parade her shame, hid her face
eternally from the light of day; and in possibly
<a name="p148" id="p148"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>148<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>a more limited circle there had been abundant
pity for the man as well. Settling down to
watch the issue out, the town, from the outset,
had respected the unbendable, unbreakable
fortitude of the man, and respected, also, the
indomitable persistency of the woman.</p>

<p>For a variety of very self-evident reasons no
one had ever or would ever meddle in the personal
affairs of Major Foxmaster. For reasons
that were equally good, though perhaps not
so easy to define in words, none meddled with
her either. Street gamins feared to jeer her
as she passed, without knowing exactly why
they feared.</p>

<p>In these ten years the breaks in the strange
relationship had been few and short. Once a
year, on an average, the Major made short
trips back to Virginia, presumably upon business
pertaining to his estate and his investments.
Such times the woman was not seen
abroad. Once, in ’79, for a week, and once
again, just following the great blizzard of ’81,
she was missed for a few days; and people wondered
whether she was ailing or housebound, or
what. For those days the Major walked without
his shadow. Then the swathed figure reappeared,
tracking him about as before.</p>

<p>Time undeniably was working its changed
with Major Foxmaster, as with his surroundings.
He must be about sixty now; but, seeing
him for the first time, you might have been pardoned
for setting him down as a man of
<a name="p149" id="p149"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>149<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>seventy or thereabouts&mdash;he looked it. His shoulders,
which formerly he carried squared back
so splendidly, were beginning to fold in upon
the casing of his ribs. His hair used to be
black, shot with white hairs; it was now white,
shot with a few black hairs. His back had had
a hollow in it; there was a curve in it yet, but
the curve was outward instead of inward.
When a man’s figure develops convex lines
where there used to be concavities, that man
is getting on; and the Major plainly was getting
on pretty fast. His eyes, which remained
dignifiedly and defiantly scornful of all the
world, and of all the world might think and
might say, nevertheless were filmed over the
least bit, so that they lost something of their
icy blue keenness. His face, though, with the
jaws sinking in upon the shrunken gums and
the brows growing shaggier, was as much of a
mask as it had ever been.</p>

<p>What was true of Major Foxmaster was
seemingly not true of her who followed him.
Within the flapping shapelessness of her disguise
her figure showed as straight and supple
as in the beginning, and her noiseless step was
as nimble and quick as ever it had been. And
that was a mighty strange thing too. It was
as though her shroud of wrappings, which kept
the sunshine and the wind off her, kept off age
too.</p>

<p>This very same thought came at length into
Major Foxmaster’s head. It took lodgment
<a name="p150" id="p150"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>150<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>there and sprouted, sending out roots into all
the odd corners of his mind. It is not for me
to tell why or how he got this notion, or exactly
when. It is for me merely to narrate as
briefly as may be the progress of the obsession
and its consequences.</p>


<p class="tb"><br class="ns"
 />Another five years passed, and then three,
making eight more on top of the first ten.
Major Foxmaster was crowding seventy; he
looked eighty. Men and women who had been
children when he moved out from Virginia were
themselves almost face to face with impending
middle age and had children of their own growing
up, who, in their turn, would hear the story
of Major Foxmaster’s shadow and bear it forward
into yet another generation. The stone
copings above the Gaunt House door were
sooty black with the accretions of decades; for
this was a soft-coal town, and factories, with
tall chimneys that constantly vomited out
greasy black smoke, had crept up, taking the
old hotel by flank and by rear. The broken
shade in the right-hand lower front window
of the old Gresham place, across the way, was
gone altogether, having parted its rotted fabric
from its decayed fastenings; so the bleak, bare
face of the house winked with one dead eye
and stared with the other.</p>

<p>The crotchety bay mare was long gone to
the bone yard. Her hide was chair bottoms
and her gristles were glue; and out on the
<a name="p151" id="p151"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>151<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>trotting track wealthy young bloods of the town
exercised her get and her skittish grand-get.
The Major did not drive a harness nag any
more&mdash;he had a palsy of the hands and a stoop
of the spine; but in most regards he adhered
to the old habits. He took his daily constitutionals&mdash;sometimes
alone&mdash;except, of course,
for the tagging black shape behind him&mdash;oftener
with the octogenarian Sherwan; and of
evenings he played his poker games at the
Kenilworth Club, which, after the way of
ultraconservative clubs, stood fast on its original
site, even though the neighbourhood about
it was so distressfully altered. His heels had
quit ringing against the sidewalk; instead, his
legs lifted tremulously and his feet felt for a
purchase on the earth when he set them down.</p>

<p>His face was no longer chipped grey flint; it
was a chalk-white, with deep lines in it. The
gold-headed cane of ebony wood, which he
carried always, had ceased to be an ornament
to his gait and had become a necessary prop
to his step. His jaws sagged in until there
were deep recesses at the corners of his mouth;
and there, in those little hollow places, the
spittle would accumulate in tiny patches. Possibly,
by reason of the bleary casts that had
overspread them, his eyes&mdash;still the faithfully
inscrutable peepholes of his brain&mdash;gave no
betrayal of the racking thoughts behind them.
They were racking thoughts too. The delusion
was a mania now&mdash;a besetting mania, feeding
<a name="p152" id="p152"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>152<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>on silence and isolation, colouring and tincturing
all the processes of his intellect.</p>

<p>By years&mdash;so he reasoned it out with himself
in every waking hour&mdash;by years, she who
bided within that shuttered house over the
way was his age, or near it. By rights, her
draped form should be as shrunken and warped
as his own. By rights, the face behind that
thick black veil should be as old as his, and
bleached, moreover, to a corpsey paleness.
Yet the furtive glances he stole over his shoulder
told him that the figure behind him moved
as alertly erect as ever it had; that its movements
had the same sure and silent swiftness.</p>

<p>So that, after a while, Major Foxmaster
began to think things that no entirely sane
man has any business thinking. He began to
say to himself that now he had solved the
secret which, all these years, had been kept
from his ken. A curse had been put upon him&mdash;that
was it; that must be it! Behind that veil
was no face old and sunken and wasted as his
was, but, instead, a young, plump face, with
luminous grey eyes set in it, and a sweet, full
mouth, and about it wavings of lustrous, rich
brown hair&mdash;the face of the girl he once loved
as she looked in the days before he quit loving
her.</p>

<p>He held up his own hands before his watery
eyes. They were trembly, wrinkled hands,
gnarled in their knuckles, corded on their
backs. They were the colour of scorched
<a name="p153" id="p153"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>153<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>leather&mdash;the texture of it too. But hers must
be the plump little white hands he remembered,
with rosy-pink palms and bright, pointed nails.
Before a long mirror in his dressing room he
studied himself&mdash;studied his bowed back and
his hunching shoulders and his shaky shanks&mdash;and
all. Her figure, inside its flapping black
draperies, was straight as an arrow; her head
poised itself firmly upright on her shoulders.
That much at least he knew; so if that much
were true, why was not the rest of it true
too?</p>

<p>It was not fair! According to his lights he
had fought out the fight with only such weapons
as Nature and his own will gave him; but
the Supreme Handicapper had stacked the
cards against him. He was bound to lose the
long, long race. He could not last much longer.
He could feel age tugging at every flabby
muscle; infirmity was forever fingering his
tissues, seeking the most vulnerable spot at
which to strike in at him.</p>

<p>He would lie down and die. And not until
then&mdash;not until the last rattle of breath had
scaped out of his collapsing windpipe; not until
she, still triumphantly active and alert and
youthful, still cloaked and gloved and hooded,
had followed his sapped, empty shell to the
graveyard&mdash;would she surrender and shrivel
into her rightful semblance, growing old and
feeble in an hour or in a day. It was not fair&mdash;this
conjury business! From the beginning he
<a name="p154" id="p154"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>154<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>never had a chance to win. All the days of
his manhood he had walked with a living nightmare.
Why, in dying, should he be doomed
to point the moral of a living ghost tale?</p>

<p>First he told himself it could not be true;
that it was a hideous imagination born of his
broodings. This was the fag-end of the nineteenth
century in which he lived, when supernatural
events did not happen. Then he told
himself it must be true&mdash;the testimony before
his eyes proved the fact of what he could not
see. Then something happened which, as far
as Major Foxmaster was concerned, settled the
issue.</p>

<p>On a winter night, after rough weather, the
Major came feebly out of the Kenilworth Club,
groping his way and muttering to himself.
This habit of muttering to himself was one
that had come on him just lately.</p>

<p>There were patches of ice upon the sidewalk,
and the wind, like a lazy housewife, had
dusted the snow back into corners and under
projections. Between the porticoes of the
doorway his foot slipped on one of these little
ice patches. He threw out his gloved left hand
to catch at some support and his fingers closed
on her black-clad arm, where she had drawn
herself into the shelter and shadow of the door-arch
to await his appearance.</p>

<p>For the first time in nearly fifty years he
touched her.</p>

<p>He jerked his hand back and fled away at a
<a name="p155" id="p155"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>155<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>staggering, crippling run; and, as he ran to hide
himself within his rooms, in panting gulps he
blasphemed the name of his Maker; for to his
feel her flesh, through the thick cloth sleeve on
her arm, had seemed to him to be as firm and
plump as it had felt when he was twenty-two
and she was twenty. The evidence was complete.</p>


<p class="tb"><br class="ns"
 />All through the next day he kept himself
behind closed doors, wrestling with his torments;
but in the evening old Sherwan came
for him and he dressed himself. They started
out together, a doddering, tottering twain;
suggesting, when they halted for a moment
to rest at the foot of the office stairs, a pair of
grey locust husks from which age, spider-fashion,
had sucked out all the rich juices of
health and strength; suggesting, when they
went on again, a pair of crawling sick beetles
which, though sick, still could crawl a little.</p>

<p>Side by side they crossed the tarnished,
shabby old lobby, with its clumpings of dingy
grey pillars and its red-plush sofa seats, and,
in the centre, its rotunda mounting to the roof,
up floor by floor, in spiral rings that in perspective
graduated smaller and smaller, like an
inverted funnel; and side by side they issued
forth from beneath the morguelike copings of
the outer door and descended the Gaunt House
steps&mdash;Major Foxmaster feeling ahead of him
with his cane, and Judge Sherwan patting his
<a name="p156" id="p156"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>156<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>left breast with his open hand&mdash;just as Policeman
Joel Bosler, now dead and gone, had seen
them do upon many another such evening as
this. Promptly and inevitably befell another
thing, then, which likewise the late deceased
Bosler had witnessed times without number.</p>

<p>From the darker space beyond the corner
lamp-post, out into the gassy yellow circle of
radiance, appeared the straight, gliding black
form, advancing on silent, padded feet and
without visible effort, relentlessly to follow
after them wheresoever they might choose to go.</p>

<p>So, then, at sight of the familiar apparition
the icy shell of half a century thawed and
broke to bits and was washed away in a freshet
of agony; and to his one friend, for one moment,
Major Foxmaster bared his wrung and
tortured soul. He threw down his cane and
threw up his arms.</p>

<p>“Sherwan,” he shrieked out, “I can’t stand
it any longer&mdash;I can’t stand it! It’s killing me!
I must look at the face&mdash;I must know!”</p>

<p>With a sudden frenzied energy he darted
at the cloaked shape. It hesitated, shrinking
back from his onward rush as though daunted;
but he fixed his clutching fingers in the crêpe
veil and tore it in twisted rags from the front
of its wearer, and the light shone full on the
face revealed beneath the close black hood of
the bonnet. &hellip; He gave one blubbery, slobbered,
hideous yell and fell flat at the base of
the lamp-post.</p>

<p><a name="p157" id="p157"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>157<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span>Old Sherwan saw the face too. Swollen and
strengthened with senile rage, he seized the
figure by both its arms and shook it.</p>

<p>“You hussy! You wench! You Jezebel!
You she-devil!” he howled at the top of his
cracked voice, and rocked his prisoner to and
fro. “What’s this? What does this mean, you
hell spawn?”</p>

<p>A dart of pain nipped at his diseased heart
then, and closed his throat. For a moment,
without words, they struggled together. With
a heave of her supple arms she broke his hold.
She shoved him off from her and reared back
on her heels, breathing hard&mdash;a full-blooded
negress, with chalky popeyes and thick, purplish
lips that curled away in a wide snarl from
the white teeth, and a skin that was blacker
than sin.</p>

<p>“Whut does hit mean?” she answered; and,
through stress of fear and mounting hope and
exultation, her voice rose to a camp-meeting
shout:</p>

<p>“I tells you whut hit means: Hit means Ise
Minnie Brownell, Ole Miss’ cook. Hit means
Ole Miss is been daid ’mos’ fo’teen years&mdash;ever
sence she taken down sick endurin’ de
big blizzard. Hit means dat w’en she lay a-dyin’
she put de promise onto me to bury
her in secret; an’ den to put on her clo’es an’
to foller, walkin’ behine dat man, daytime an’
nighttime, twell he died. Dat’s whut hit
means!”</p>

<p><a name="p158" id="p158"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>158<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span>She sought to peer past him and her tone
sharpened down, fine and keen:</p>

<p>“Is he daid? Oh, bless de good Lawd
A’mighty! Is he daid? ’Cause, ef he’s daid,
me an’ Hennery, w’ich is my lawful wedded
husban’, we kin go back to Furginia an’ claim
de prop’ty dat Ole Miss lef in trust to come
to me w’en I kin prove he’s daid. Oh, look,
please, suh, mister, and see ef he ain’t dead?”</p>

<p>Old Sherwan ran to the lamp-post and
dropped down on both his knees, and shook
his friend by the shoulders.</p>

<p>“Foxmaster!” he called. “Foxmaster, you’re
free! You’re free! I tell you, you’re free!
Foxmaster, look at me! Foxmaster, do you
hear me? You’re free, I tell you!”</p>

<p>But the Major did not hear him. The Major
was flat on his back, with his arms outstretched
and the fingers of both his hands gripped in
the rags of a black crêpe veil; and at the corners
of his mouth the little patches of spittle bubbles
were drying up. The Major would never hear
anything again in this world.</p>

<p class="newchap"><span class="dropcap ml6">If</span> there were a hundred men in a crowd
and Chester K. Pilkins was there he would
be the hundredth man. I like that introduction.
If I wrote a book about him I
doubt whether I could sum up Mr. Pilkins’
personality more completely than already I
have done in this the first sentence of this the
first paragraph of my tale. Nevertheless, I
shall try.</p>

<p>Card-indexing him, so to speak, filling in the
dotted lines after the fashion pursued by a
candidate for admission to Who’s Whosoever
Can, we attain this result: Name? Chester
K(irkham) Pilkins; born? certainly; parentage?
one father and one mother; lives? only in a
way of speaking; married? extensively so; business?
better than it was during the panic but
not so good as it might be; recreations? reading,
writing, arithmetic and the comic supplements;
clubs? Prospect Slope Pressing, Montauk
Chess, Checkers and Whist, King’s County
<a name="p160" id="p160"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>160<span class="ns">]

on Sunday, rarely on week-days; politics? whatever
is the rule; height? sub-average; weight?
less than sub-average; hair? same as eyes; eyes?
same as hair; complexion? variable, but inclining
to be fair, and warmer in moments of
embarrassment; special distinguishing characteristics?
Oh, say, what’s the use?</p>

<p>This would apply to Chester K. Pilkins as
once he was, not as now he is. For there
has been a change. As will develop. But at
the time when we begin our study of him Mr.
Pilkins resided in a simple and unostentatious
manner in Brooklyn, N. Y., on one of those
streets which are named for semi-tropical flowering
shrubs for the same reason that hunting
dogs are named for Greek goddesses and race
horses for United States senators and tramp
steamers for estimable maiden ladies. In a
small, neat house, almost entirely surrounded
by rubber plants, he lived with his wife, Mrs.
Gertrude Maud Pilkins. This phraseology is
by deliberate intent. His wife did not live
with him. He lived with her. To have referred<!-- original reads 're-referred' (hyphen at linebreak) -->
to this lady as his better half would be
dealing in improper fractions. At the very
lowest computation possible, she was his better
eight-tenths.</p>

<p>By profession he was an expert bookkeeper,
in the employ of a firm doing a large bond and
stock brokerage business on the sinful or Manhattan
shore of the East River. The tragedy
<a name="p161" id="p161"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>161<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>and the comedy, the sordid romance and the
petty pathos of Wall Street rolled in an unheeded
torrent over his head as he, submerged
deep in the pages of his ledgers, sat all day
long dotting his <i>i</i>’s and crossing his <i>t</i>’s, adding
his columns and finding his totals. Sometimes
of evenings he stayed on to do special accounting
jobs for smaller concerns in need of his
professional services.</p>

<p>Otherwise, when five o’clock came he took
off his little green-baize apron, his green eyeshade
and his black calico sleeve protectors,
slipped on his detachable cuffs, his hat and his
coat, took his umbrella in hand, and leaving
New York and its wicked, wanton ways behind
him, he joined with half a million other
struggling human molecules in the evening
bridge crush&mdash;that same bridge crush of which
the metropolis is so justly ashamed and so
properly proud&mdash;and was presently at home
in Brooklyn, which is a peaceful country landscape,
pastoral in all its instincts, but grown
up quite thickly with brick and mortar. There
he gave his evenings to the society of his wife,
to the chess problems printed from time to
time in the <cite>Eagle</cite>, and to reading his encyclopedia,
which had been purchased on the instalment
plan, at the rate of so much down, so
much a week. It seemed probable that Mr.
Pilkins would finish reading his encyclopedia
before he finished paying for it, which is more
than most of us can say, however literary our
<a name="p162" id="p162"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>162<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>aims and aspirations. He liked to pick up a
volume for half an hour or so immediately prior
to his retiring. He said it rested him. He had
got as far as the middle of the very interesting
one named <cite>Gib to Jibe</cite>. Once in a while, though,
the Pilkinses went out in society. That is to
say, Mrs. Pilkins went, and took Mr. Pilkins
with her.</p>

<p>I would not have you believe from all this
that Mr. Pilkins entertained no views of his
own on current topics. His convictions upon
certain heads were most definite and settled,
and on favourable occasions openly he voiced
them. Among other things he believed that
if somebody would only start up an old-time
minstrel show, such as we used to see when we
were boys, it would make a fortune; that the
newspapers printed a pack of lies every day
because they had to have something to fill up
their columns; that there was a great deal of
grafting going on and something should be
done about it right away; that the winters were
changing, because of the Gulf Stream or something,
so you couldn’t depend on the climate
any more; that owing to the high cost of living
it was practically impossible to get a good
sixty-cent table-d’hôte dinner nowadays; and
that Mrs. Pilkins was in many respects a very
unusual woman.</p>

<p>She was all of that. Get Gertrude Maud.
She looms before us, large and full of figure,
majestic of bearing and fair of face, her general
<a name="p163" id="p163"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>163<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>aspect indeed a very general aspect. She was
competent by inheritance and domineering by
instinct. It was common talk in the circle in
which Gertrude Maud moved, towing Chester
behind her, that she had Bohemian leanings.
True, she had never smoked a cigarette in all
her blameless life, nor touched her lips to strong
drink; nor yet had she patronised studio teas
and attended the indoor anarchistic revels of
the parlour-radicals established in the neighbourhood
of Washington Square. Rather she
betrayed her Bohemian trend by what she wore
than by what she did.</p>

<p>She was addicted to festooning about her
neck large polished beads of the more popular
hard woods and upon her bosom plaquelike
articles which apparently had originated with
a skilled cabinetmaker and joiner. Her wrists
and her forearms she adorned with art-work
bracelets of hammered metals set with large
muddy-looking stones&mdash;almost anything that
would look well in a collection of geological
specimens was, in the eyes of Gertrude Maud,
jewelry. Her costumes of state, displayed in
connection with these ornamentations culled
from the vegetable and mineral kingdoms, were
cut square in the neck and extended straight
up and down, being ungirthed at the waistline
but set off with red and blue edgings, after
the style of fancy tea towels. As her woman
friends often remarked in tones of admiration,
she had never worn stays in her life, and yet
<a name="p164" id="p164"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>164<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>just look what a figure she had! Sometimes,
the weather being favourable, she wore sandals.</p>

<p>Excelling, as she did, in the social graces,
Mrs. Pilkins was greatly in demand for neighbourhood
parties. She was an amateur palmist
of great note. At a suitable time in the course
of the evening’s festivities she would possess
herself of the left hand of some gentleman or
lady present&mdash;usually a gentleman’s hand&mdash;and
holding it palm upward, she would gently
massage its surface and then begin uttering
little gasping sounds betokening intense surprise
and gratification.</p>

<p>“Do you know, really,” she would say when
she had in part recovered, such being the regular
formula, “I don’t believe in all my experience
I hardly ever saw such an interesting
hand?”</p>

<p>Peering close and ever closer she would trace
out the past, the present and the future, seeing
strange influences coming into the other’s life,
and long journeys and dark strangers; and presently,
with a startled cry, she would pounce
upon the heart line, and then, believe me, she
would find out things worth telling! And if
the owner of the captive hand chanced to be a
young man whose life was so exemplary as to
be downright painful, he would endeavour by
his air to convey the impression that the fence
round the South Flatbush Young Ladies’ Seminary
had been builded extra high and extra
strong especially on his dangerous account.
<a name="p165" id="p165"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>165<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>Hardly could the rest wait to have Mrs. Pilkins
read their palms too. And while this went on,
Mr. Pilkins would be hanging about on the
outskirts of the group, feeling very null and
void. Really his only excuse for being there
at all was that Gertrude Maud needed some one
to get her rubbers off and on and to bring her
home.</p>

<p>Naturally, as one adept in the divination of
the dearest characteristics of men and women,
and also because she was a wife and subject
to the common delusions of wives as a class,
Mrs. Pilkins felt she knew Chester&mdash;felt she
could read him like a book. This only goes to
show how wrong a woman and a wife can be.
For behind the mild and pinkish mask which
he showed to her and to creation at large
Chester Pilkins nursed unsuspected ambitions,
undreamed-of dreams. He hankered with a
hankering which was almost a pain to stand for
once anyhow before the eyes of the world.
Within him a secret fire seethed; he ached and
glowed with it, and yet none knew of it. He
would have died in his tracks before he voiced
his burning desire to any human being, yet
constantly it abode with him. He was tired&mdash;oh,
so tired&mdash;of being merely one of the six
millions. He craved to be one among the six
millions. He peaked and he pined with it.</p>

<p>This longing is commoner probably among
city dwellers than among those who live in the
smaller settlements of men, and for that there
<a name="p166" id="p166"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>166<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>is, as I believe, a good and sufficient reason.
In the little community there are no nobodies.
Anybody is somebody. But where the multitude
is close-packed, nearly anybody is everybody
and nearly everybody is anybody. The
greater the number within a given space, the
fewer are there available for purposes of pomp,
prominence and publicity. A few stand out
above the ruck; the rest make up the unconsidered
mass&mdash;mute, inglorious and, except
briefly in the census figures, unsung. And
Chester K. Pilkins yearned to stand out.</p>

<p>Twice in his life he had thought he was about
to attain conspicuousness and be pointed out
by men as something other than Mrs. Chester
K. Pilkins’ husband. They were narrow escapes,
both of them. Because each was such
a narrow escape, that made the disappointment
all the greater. Once on a rainy, blowy
evening, when the narrow gore of Nassau Street
where it debouches into Park Row was a mushroom
bed of wet, black umbrella tops and the
bridge crush at the mouth of the Bridge took
on an added frenzy, a taxicab, driven at most
unlawful speed, bored through the fringes of
the press, knocked a man galley west, and,
never checking its gait, fled into the shelter
of the L pillars toward Chatham Square and
was gone from sight before more than six or
eight spectators could get its license numbers
wrong.</p>

<p>The man was Chester K. Pilkins. He was
<a name="p167" id="p167"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>167<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>butted violently from behind as he fought his
way across the asphalt, with his collar turned
up against the wet gusts and his thoughts intent
on getting a seat aboard the transpontine
car. He never had gotten a seat aboard it yet,
but there was no telling when he might. Immediately
on being struck he was projected
some yards through space in a galley-westerly
direction, and when he struck he rolled over
and over in the mud, greatly to the detriment
of a neat black overcoat buttoning under a fly
front, and with silk facings upon the lapels,
then in its third season of service. Kind hands&mdash;very
many of them&mdash;lifted him up from
where he lay with a long scratch on his nose
and a passing delusion within his brain that
he had taken a long rough trip somewhere and
was coming back by slow stages. Sympathetic
persons, about equally divided in their opinion
as to whether most of his bones were or were
not broken, bore him with all gentleness into
the drug store in the World Building, propped
him against a show case, and packed about him
in a dense mass, those good Samaritans in the
front row calling upon those behind them to
stand back, in heaven’s name, and give him a
little air. There a kindly disposed bootblack
brushed him off, and a soda-water clerk offered
him malted milk with a dash of nerve tonic in
it, and a policeman, using a stubby lead pencil,
took down his name and address in a little red
book, and a blithe young interne came on the
<a name="p168" id="p168"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>168<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>tail of an ambulance with a kit of surgical
tools in his hand, and presently departed, obviously
disappointed to find there was no need
of a capital operation to be performed forthwith
upon the spot; and, altogether, the victim
was made much of. A little later, somewhat
shaken and sore but not materially damaged,
he rode home&mdash;standing up and swaying in the
aisle, as was customary&mdash;holding with one hand
to a strap and with the other at intervals caressing
his wounded nose.</p>

<p>Next morning he bought all the morning
papers printed in English&mdash;there are still a
considerable number of morning papers in
Greater New York that are printed in English&mdash;and
with a queer, strangled little beat of
anticipatory pride in his throat-pulse he
searched assiduously through all of them, page
by page and heading by heading, for the account
of his accident. He regarded that accident
in a proprietary sense. If it wasn’t his,
whose then was it? Only one paper out of all
the lot had seen fit to mention the affair. In
a column captioned Small Brevities he found
at last a single, miserable, puny six-line paragraph
to the effect that a pedestrian&mdash;pedestrian,
mind you!&mdash;giving his name as Charles
Piffles, had been knocked down by an unidentified
automobile, and after having been given
first-aid treatment by Patrolman Roger P.
Dugan, of the Peck’s Slip Station, and receiving
further attention at the hands of Ambulance
<a name="p169" id="p169"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>169<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>Surgeon Max Loeb, who came from Battery
Place Hospital in response to a call, was able
to go to his home, at such and such an address,
borough of Brooklyn. And even the house
number as set down was incorrect. From that
hour dated Chester K. Pilkins’ firm and bitter
belief in the untrustworthiness of the metropolitan
press.</p>

<p>The other time was when he was drawn on a
panel for jury duty in the trial of a very fashionable
and influential murderer. A hundred
householders were netted in that venire<!-- TN: OK, means "jury pool" -->, and
of the number I daresay Chester Pilkins was
the hundredth. With the ninety and nine
others he reported at a given hour at a given
courtroom, and there for two days he waited
while slowly the yawning jury box filled with
retired real-estate dealers and jobbers in white
goods. Finally his own name was reached and
the clerk called it out loudly and clearly.
Shaking the least bit in his knees and gulping
hard to keep his Adam’s apple inside his collar,
Mr. Pilkins took the stand and nervously
pledged himself truthfully to answer all such
questions as might be put to him touching on
his qualifications for service in the case now on
trial. He did answer them truthfully; more
than that, he answered them satisfactorily. He
had no conscientious scruples against the infliction
of capital punishment for the crime of
murder in the first degree. From his readings
of the public prints he had formed no set and
<a name="p170" id="p170"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>170<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>definite opinion as to the guilt or innocence
of the accused. He was not personally acquainted
with the deceased, with the prisoner
at the bar, with the attorneys upon either side,
with the officers who had made the arrest,
with the coroner’s physician who had conducted
the autopsy, or with any one connected in any
way with the case. He professed himself as
willing to be guided by His Honour on the
bench in all matters pertaining to the laws of
evidence, while exclusively reserving the right
to be his own judge of the weight and value of
the testimony itself. So far, so good.</p>

<p>The district attorney nodded briefly. The
lawyers for the murderer, confabbing with their
heads together, gave no sign of demur. The
presiding justice, a large man, heavily moustached
and with more chins than he could possibly
need, who had been taking a light nap,
was aroused by the hush which now befell and
sat up, rustling in his black silk sleeping
gown.</p>

<p>Behind Chester Pilkins’ waistcoat Chester
Pilkins’ heart gave a little gratified jump. He
was about to be accepted; he would be in the
papers. He saw a sketch artist, who sat just
beyond the rail, squint at him from under his
eyebrows and lower a pencil to a scratch pad
which was poised upon a right kneecap. A
picture would be published. What mattered
it though this picture would purely look excessively
unlike him? Would not the portrait
<a name="p171" id="p171"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>171<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>be suitably labelled? Mentally he visualised
the precious lines:</p>

<p>Juror No. 9&mdash;Chester K. Pilkins, No. 373
Japonica Avenue; certified accountant; 39;
married; no children.</p>

<p>From somewhere back of the moustache His
Honour’s voice was heard rumbling forth hoarsely:</p>

<p>“If-no-objections-from-either-side-let-juror-be-sworn.”</p>

<p>At Mr. Pilkins’ side appeared a court functionary
bearing a grimed and venerable volume
containing many great truths upon its insides
and many hungry germs upon its outside. Mr.
Pilkins arose to his feet and stretched forth a
slightly tremulous hand to rest it upon The
Book. In this moment he endeavoured to appear
in every outward aspect the zealous citizen,
inspired solely by a sense of his obligations
to himself and to the state. A sort of Old
Roman pose it was. And in that same moment
the blow fell and the alabaster vase was shattered.</p>

<p>Senior counsel for the defence&mdash;the one with
the long frock coat and the sobbing catch in
his voice&mdash;bobbed up from where he sat.</p>

<p>“Defence-excuses-this-gentleman,” he grunted,
all in one word, and sat down again.</p>

<p>The artist scratched out a shadowy outline
of the lobe of Mr. Pilkins’ left ear and the
southeastern slope of his skull&mdash;for already
this talented draftsman had progressed thus
<a name="p172" id="p172"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>172<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>far with the portrait&mdash;and in less than no time
our Mr. Pilkins, surcharged now with a sense
of injury and vaguely feeling that somehow
his personal honour had been impugned, was
being waved away from the stand to make room
for a smallish, darkish gentleman of a Semitic
aspect. With his thoughts in such turmoil that
he forgot to take with him the bone-handled
umbrella which he had carried for two years
and better, he left the courtroom.</p>

<p>Really, though, he never had a chance. The
defence had expended upon him one of its
dwindling store of peremptory challenges because
in the moment of being sworn he appeared
a person of so stern and uncompromising
an exterior. “Besides,” the senior counsel had
whispered hurriedly to his associates&mdash;“besides,
he seems so blamed anxious to serve.
Bad sign&mdash;better let him go.” And so they
let him go. But, on the other hand, had he
worn a look less determined the district attorney
would have challenged him on the suspicion
of being too kind-hearted. The jury
system is a priceless heritage of our forefathers,
and one of the safeguards of our liberties, but
we do things with it of which I sometimes
think the forefathers never dreamed.</p>

<p>Thus, with its periods of hopefulness and its
periods of despairing, life for our hero rolled
on after the placid fashion of bucolic Brooklyn,
adrowse among its mortary dells and its masonry
dingles, until there came the year 1915
<a name="p173" id="p173"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>173<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>A.&nbsp;D. and of the Constitution of the United
States the One Hundred and I forget which.
For long the Pilkinses had been saving up to
take a trip to Europe, Chester particularly desiring
to view the Gothic cathedrals of the
Continent, about which Volume <cite>Cad to Eve</cite> of
his encyclopedia discoursed at great length and
most entertainingly. For her part, Mrs. Chester
intended to mingle in the gay life of the
artistic set of the Latin Quarter, and then
come home and tell about it.</p>

<p>By the summer of 1914 there was laid by a
sum sufficient to pay all proper costs of the
tour. And then, with unpardonable inconsiderateness,
this war had to go and break out.
The war disagreeably continuing, Europe was
quite out of the question. If Europe must
have a war it couldn’t have the Pilkinses. So
in the early spring of the following year, the
combined thoughts of Mr. and Mrs. Pilkins
turned longingly westward. Mr. Pilkins had
never been beyond Buffalo but once; that was
when, on their wedding tour, they went to
Niagara Falls. Mrs. Pilkins once had visited
her married sister residing in Xenia, Ohio.
Such portion of the Great West as lay beyond
Xenia was to her as a folded scroll. So Westward
Ho! it was.</p>

<p>I deem it to have been eminently characteristic
of Chester that he spent three evenings
preparing, with the aid of timetables, descriptive
folders furnished by a genial and
<a name="p174" id="p174"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>174<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>accommodating ticket agency and a condensed hotel
directory, a complete schedule of their projected
itinerary, including the times of arrivals and departures
of trains, stop-overs, connections, cab
and bus fares, hotel rates, baggage regulations,
and what not. Opposite the name of one junction
town beyond the Rockies he even set
down a marginal note: “At this point see
Great American Desert.”</p>

<p>Leaving Chicago on the second lap of the
outbound half of the momentous journey, they
took a section in a sleeping car named appropriately
for a Hindu deity. For once in his
life Chester was above his wife, where he could
look down upon her. But that was in the nighttime,
when he lodged in the upper. Daytimes
he reverted to his original and regular state,
becoming again one of the submerged tenth of
one-tenth. In the dining car Mrs. Pilkins selected
the dishes and gave the orders, and he,
submissive as the tapeworm, ate of what was
put before him, asking no questions. In the
club car, among fellow travellers of his own sex,
he was as one set apart. They talked over
him and round him and if needs be through
him to one another; and when, essaying to be
heard upon the topics of the day, then under
discussion, he lifted up his voice some individual
of a more commanding personality&mdash;the member
of the legislature from Michigan or the
leading osteopath of Council Bluffs&mdash;would lift
his voice yet higher, wiping him out as
<a name="p175" id="p175"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>175<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>completely as though he had been a naught done
in smudged chalk upon a blackboard. After
all, life in the free and boundless West threatened
to become for him what life in cribbed,
cabined and confined Brooklyn had been; this
was the distressing reflection which frequently
recurred to him as he retired all squelched and
muted from the unequal struggle, and it made
his thoughts dark with melancholy. Was there
in all this wide continent no room for true
worth when habited in native modesty?</p>

<p>In time they reached a certain distinguished
city of the Coast, nestling amid its everlasting
verdure and real-estate boomers. But in the
rainless season the verdure shows an inclination
to dry up. However, this was in the verdant
springtime, when Nature everywhere, and
especially in California, is gladsome and all-luxuriant.
From the station a bus carried
them through thriving suburbs to a large tourist
hotel built Spanish Mission style and run American
plan. The young man behind the clerk’s
desk took one prognostic look at Chester as
Chester registered, and reached for a certain
key, but while in the act of so doing caught a
better glimpse of Mrs. Chester, and, changing
his mind, gave them a very much better room
at the same price. There was something about
Mrs. Pilkins.</p>

<p>That evening, entering the dining-room,
which was a great, soft-pine Sahara of a place
dotted at regular intervals with circular oases
<a name="p176" id="p176"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>176<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>called tables, each flowing with ice water and
abounding in celery, in the native ripe olives
shining in their own oils, and in yellow poppy
blossoms in vases, the Pilkinses instantly and
intuitively discovered that they had been ushered
into a circle new to them. Some of the
diners in sight were plainly, like themselves,
tourists, transients, fly-by-night sightseers from
the East, here to-day and going to-morrow.
But sundry others present, being those who
had the look about them of regular guests,
were somehow different. Without being told,
the newcomers at once divined that they were
in a haunt of the moving-picture folk, and also
by the same processes of instinctive discernment
were informed of another thing: As between
the actors newly recruited from that
realm of art which persons of a reminiscent
turn of mind are beginning to speak of as the
spoken drama, and the actors who had been
bred up and developed by its one-time little
half-sister, the moving-picture game, a classifying
and separating distinction existed. It was
a distinction not definable in words, perhaps;
nevertheless, it was as apparent there in that
dining-room as elsewhere. You know how the
thing goes in other lines of allied industries?
Take two agents now&mdash;a road agent, let us say,
and a book agent. Both are agents; both belong
to the predatory group; both ply their
trades upon the highway with utter strangers
for their chosen prey; and yet in the first flash
<a name="p177" id="p177"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>177<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>we can tell a book agent from a road agent, and
vice versa. So it was with these ladies and gentlemen
upon whom Chester K. Pilkins and wife&mdash;beg
pardon, Mrs. Chester K. Pilkins and husband&mdash;now
gazed.</p>

<p>At the table to which a post-graduate head-waitress
escorted them and there surrendered
them into the temporary keeping of a sophomore
side-waitress there sat, in a dinner coat,
a young man of most personable appearance
and address, with whom, as speedily developed,
it was not hard to become acquainted, but, on
the contrary, easy. Almost as soon as the
Pilkinses were seated he broke through the
film ice of formality by remarking that Southern
California was, on the whole, a wonderful
country, was it not? Speaking as one, or as
one and a fractional part of another, they
agreed with him. Did it not possess a wonderful
climate? It did. And so on and so forth.
You know how one of these conversations grows,
expands and progresses.</p>

<p>Presently there were mutual introductions
across the fronded celery and the self-lubricating
ripe olive. This accomplished, Mr. Pilkins
was upon the point of stating that he was in
the accounting line, when their new acquaintance,
evidently holding such a detail to be of
no great consequence, broke in upon him with
a politely murmured “Excuse me” and proceeded
to speak of a vastly more interesting
subject. His name, as they already knew, was
<a name="p178" id="p178"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>178<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>Mr. Royal Harcourt. He was of the theatrical
profession, a thing they already had guessed.
He told them more&mdash;much more.</p>

<p>It would seem that for long he had withstood
the blandishments and importunities of the
moving-picture producers, standing, as it were,
aloof from them and all their kind, holding ever
that the true artist should remain ever the true
artist, no matter how great the financial temptation
to enter the domain of the silent play
might be. But since so many of equal importance
in the profession had gone into the pictures&mdash;and
besides, after all was said and done,
did not the pictures cater educationally to a
great number of doubtlessly worthy persons
whose opportunity for acquaintance with the
best work of the legitimate stage was necessarily
limited and curtailed?&mdash;well, any way, to
make a long story no longer, he, Mr. Royal
Harcourt, had gone into the pictures himself,
and here he was. Taking it that he had been
appealed to, Mr. Pilkins nodded in affirmation
of the wisdom of the step, and started to speak.
“Excuse me, please,” said Mr. Harcourt courteously
but firmly. Plainly Mr. Harcourt was not
yet done. He resumed. One who had a following
might always return to the legitimate finding
that following unimpaired. Meanwhile, the picture
business provided reasonably pleasant employment
at a most attractive remuneration.</p>

<p>“So, as I said just now,” went on Mr. Harcourt,
“here I am and here you find me. I
<a name="p179" id="p179"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>179<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>may tell you that I am specially engaged for
the filming of that popular play, The Prince
of the Desert, which the Ziegler Company is
now making here at its studios. My honorarium&mdash;this,
of course, is in confidence&mdash;my honorarium
for this is eight hundred dollars a week.”
He glanced at their faces. “In fact, strictly
between ourselves, nine hundred and fifty.”
And with a polished finger nail Mr. Harcourt
flicked an imaginary bit of fluff from a fluffless
coat lapel.</p>

<p>Awe descended upon the respective souls of
his listeners, and there lingered.</p>

<p>“And of course for that&mdash;that figure&mdash;you
play the leading part?” Mrs. Pilkins put the
question almost reverently.</p>

<p>A trace, just a trace, of unconscious bitterness
trickled into their tablemate’s voice as he
answered:</p>

<p>“No, madam, I could hardly go so far as to
say that&mdash;hardly so far as to say that exactly.
My good friend, Mr. Basil Derby, has the title
rôle. He originated the part on Broadway&mdash;perhaps
that explains it. I play the American
newspaper correspondent&mdash;a strong part, yet
with touches of pure comedy interspersed in it
here and there&mdash;a part second only to that of
the star.”</p>

<p>“Does he&mdash;this Mr. Derby&mdash;does he get anything
like what you are paid?” ventured Mr.
Pilkins. Surely the Ziegler Company tempted
bankruptcy.</p>

<p><a name="p180" id="p180"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>180<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span>“I suspect so, sir, I suspect so.”</p>

<p>Mr. Harcourt’s tone indicated subtly that
this world was as yet by no means free from
injustice.</p>

<p>Before the meal was anywhere near ended&mdash;in
fact, before they reached the orange sorbet,
coming between the roast beef <i>au jus</i> and the
choice of young chicken with giblet sauce or
cold sliced lamb with pickled beets&mdash;the Pilkinses
knew a great deal about Mr. Royal Harcourt,
and Mr. Royal Harcourt knew the
Pilkinses were good listeners, and not only
good listeners but believing ones as well. So
a pleasant hour passed speedily for all three.
There, was an especially pleasant moment just
at the close of the dinner when Mr. Harcourt
invited them to accompany him at ten o’clock
on the following morning to the Ziegler studios,
and as his guest to witness the lensing of
certain episodes destined to figure in the completed
film drama of The Prince of the Desert.
Speaking for both, Mrs. Pilkins accepted.</p>

<p>“But, Gertrude Maud,” murmured Mr. Pilkins
doubtfully as the two of them were leaving
the dining-room to hear the orchestra play in
the arched inner garden where the poinsettia
waved its fiery bannerets aloft, reminding one
somewhat of the wagging red oriflamme of a
kindred member of the same family&mdash;the Irish
setter&mdash;and the inevitable spoiled childling of
every tourist hotel romped to and fro, whining
for pure joy, making life a curse for its parents
<a name="p181" id="p181"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>181<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>and awakening in the hearts of others reconciling
thoughts touching upon the late King Herod,
the bald-headed prophet who called the bears
down out of the hills, and the style of human
sacrifices held to be most agreeable to the tastes
of the heathenish god Moloch. “But, Gertrude
Maud,” he repeated demurringly as he trailed
a pace behind her, seeing she had not heard or
seemed not to have heard. In her course Mrs.
Pilkins halted so suddenly that a double-stranded
necklet of small wooden darning eggs
of graduated sizes clinked together smartly.</p>

<p>“Chester,” she stated sharply, “don’t keep
bleating out ‘Gertrude Maud’ like that. It
annoys me. If you have anything to say,
quit mumbling and say it.”</p>

<p>“But, Ger&mdash;but, my dear,” he corrected himself
plaintively, “we were going to visit the
orange groves to-morrow morning. I have already
spoken to the automobile <span class="nw">man&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>“Chester,” said Mrs. Pilkins, “the orange
groves can wait. I understand they have been
here for some time. They will probably last
for some time longer. To-morrow morning at
ten o’clock you and I are going with that nice
Mr. Harcourt. It will be an interesting experience
and a broadening one. We are here to
be broadened. We will see something very
worth while, I am convinced of it.”</p>

<p>Indeed, they began to witness events of an
acutely unusual nature before ten o’clock. As
they came out from breakfast there darted
<a name="p182" id="p182"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>182<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>down the lobby stairs at the right a young
maiden and a youth, both most strikingly
garbed. The young lady wore a frock of broad
white-and-black stripes clingingly applied to
her figure in up-and-down lines. She had a
rounded cheek, a floating pigtail, and very
large buckles set upon the latchets of her
twinkling bootees. The youth was habited
as a college boy. At least he wore a Norfolk
jacket, a flowing tie of the Windsor, England,
and East Aurora, New York, variety, and trousers
which were much too short for him if they
were meant to be long trousers and much too
long for him if they were meant to be short
trousers. Hand in hand, with gladsome outcry,
this pair sped through the open doors and
vaulted down the porch steps without, as
nimbly as the chamois of the Alpine steeps,
toward a large touring car, wherein sat a
waiting chauffeur, most correctly liveried and
goggled.</p>

<p>Close behind them, in ardent pursuit, an
elderly, rather obese gentleman, in white waistcoat,
white side whiskers and white spats&mdash;patently
a distressed parent&mdash;tore into sight,
waving his arms and calling upon the fleeing
pair to halt. Yet halted they not. They
whisked into the rear seat of the automobile
just as the elderly gentleman tripped on a
crack in the planking of the veranda and was
precipitated headlong into the arms of a fat
bellboy who at this exact moment emerged
<a name="p183" id="p183"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>183<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>from behind a pillar. It was a very fat bellboy&mdash;one
that could not have weighed an ounce
less than two hundred pounds, nor been an hour
less than forty years old&mdash;and he was grotesquely
comical in a suit of brass buttons and
green cloth incredibly tight for him. Locked in
each other’s arms the parent and bellboy rolled
down the steps&mdash;bumpety-bump!&mdash;and as progressing
thus in close communion they reached
the surface of the driveway, a small-town policeman,
wearing long chin whiskers and an
enormous tin star, ran forward from nowhere
in particular, stumbled over their entangled
forms and fell upon them with great violence.
Then while the three of them squirmed and
wriggled there in a heap, the automobile
whirled away with the elopers&mdash;it was, of course,
by now quite plain that they must be elopers&mdash;casting
mocking, mirthsome glances backward
over their diminishing shoulders.</p>

<p>“Slap stick! Rough-house! Cheap stuff!
But it goes&mdash;somehow it goes. The public
stands for it. It passes one’s comprehension.”
It was Mr. Royal Harcourt who, standing just
behind the Pilkinses, commented in tones of
a severe disparagement. They became cognisant
also of a man who had been stationed in the
grass plot facing the hotel, grinding away at a
crank device attached to a large camera. He
had now ceased from grinding. Except for the
camera man, the disapproving Mr. Harcourt
and themselves, no one else within sight
<a name="p184" id="p184"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>184<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>appeared to take more than a perfunctory interest
in what had just occurred.</p>

<p>“Come with me,” bade Mr. Harcourt when
the outraged parent, the fat bellboy and the
small-town policeman had picked themselves
up, brushed themselves off and taken themselves
away. “You have seen one side of this great
industry. I propose now to introduce you to
another side of it&mdash;the artistic side.”</p>

<p>He waved his arm in a general direction, and
instantly a small jitneybile detached itself from
a flock of jitneybiles stationed alongside the
nearer curbing and came curving up to receive
them. This city, I may add in passing, was
the home of the original mother jitney, and
there, in her native habitat, she spawned extensively
before she moved eastward, breeding
busily as she went.</p>

<p>To the enlarged eyes of the Pilkinses strange
phases of life were recurringly revealed as the
vehicle which their guide had chartered progressed
along the wide suburban street, beneath
the shelter of the pepper trees and the palms.
Yet the residential classes living thereabout appeared
to view the things which transpired with
a languid, not to say a bored, manner; and as
for Mr. Harcourt, he, sitting in front alongside
the driver, seemed scarcely to notice them at
all.</p>

<p>For example: Two automobiles, one loaded
with French Zouaves and the other with Prussian
infantrymen, all heavily armed and
<a name="p185" id="p185"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>185<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>completely accoutred, whizzed by them, going in
the opposite direction. A most winsome,
heavily bejewelled gypsy lass flirted openly
with an affectionate butler beneath the windows
of a bungalow, while a waspish housemaid, evidently
wrought to a high pitch by emotions of
jealousy, balefully spied upon them from the
shelter of an adjacent shrubbery clump. Out
of a small fruit store emerged a benevolent,
white-haired Church of England clergyman, of
the last century but one, in cassock, flat hat
and knee breeches. With him walked a most
villainous-appearing pirate, a wretch whose
whiskered face was gashed with cutlass scars
and whose wicked legs were leathered hip-deep
in jack boots. These two were eating tangerines
from the same paper bag as they issued forth
together.</p>

<p>The car bearing our friends passed a mansion,
the handsomest upon the street. Out from its
high-columned portals into the hot sunshine
staggered a young man whose lips were very
red and whose moustache was very black, with
great hollows beneath his eyes and white patches
at his temples&mdash;a young man dressed in correct
evening attire, who, pausing for a moment,
struck his open hand to his forehead with a
gesture indicative of intense despair&mdash;you somehow
opined he had lost all at the gaming table&mdash;then
reeled from sight down a winding driveway.
One glimpsed that his glistening linen
shirt bosom was of a pronounced saffron cast,
<a name="p186" id="p186"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>186<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>with collar and tie and cuffs all of the same
bilious tone to match.</p>

<p>“Noticed the yellow, didn’t you?” asked Mr.
Harcourt. “That means he’s been doing indoor
stuff. Under the lights yellow comes out white.”</p>

<p>At the end of a long mile the jitney halted at
a gateway set in a high wooden wall beyond
which might be seen the peaks of a glass-topped
roof. About this gateway clustered a large
assemblage of citizens of all ages and conditions,
but with the young of both sexes predominating.
As the young women uniformly wore middy
blouses and the young men sport shirts, opened
at the neck, there were bared throats and wide
sailor collars wherever one looked.</p>

<p>“Extra people,” elucidated their host.
“They get three a day&mdash;when they work.
We’ll probably use a lot of them to-day.”</p>

<p>Within the inclosure a new world unfolded
itself for the travellers from the Atlantic seaboard&mdash;in
fact, sections of several new worlds.
At the heels of Mr. Harcourt they threaded
their way along a great wooden stage that was
open, front and top, to the blue skies, and as
they followed after him they looked sideways
into the interior of a wrecked and deserted Belgian
farmhouse; and next door to that into a
courtroom now empty of everything except its
furnishings; and next door to that into a gloomy
dungeon with barred windows and painted
canvas walls. They took a turn across a dusty
stretch of earth beyond the far end of the
<a name="p187" id="p187"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>187<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>segmented stage, and, lo, they stood in the gibbering
midriff of an Oriental city. Behind all was
lath, furring and plaster, chicken wire, two-by-fours
and shingle nails; but in front ’twas a cross-section
of teeming bazaar life. How far away
seemed 373 Japonica Avenue, Brooklyn, then!</p>

<p>An energetic man in laced boots and a flannel
shirt&mdash;Mr. Harcourt called him the director&mdash;peered
angrily into the perspective of the scene
and, waving a pasteboard megaphone in command,
ordained that a distant mountain should
come ten feet nearer to him. Alongside of this
young man Mohammed was an amateur. For
the mountain did obey, advancing ten feet, no
more and no less. Half a score of young men
in cowboy garb enshrouded themselves in
flowing white draperies, took long, tasselled
spears in their hands, and swung themselves
upon the backs of horses&mdash;and, behold, a tribe
of Bedouins trotted through the crowded, winding
way, scattering mendicants, priests, camel
drivers and peddlers from before their path.</p>

<p>Upon the edge of all this Chester K. Pilkins
hovered as one entranced. He had lost Mrs.
Pilkins; he was separated from Mr. Harcourt.</p>

<p>He became aware of three damsels of tender
years who sat in a row upon a pile of rough
lumber near at hand. They wore flowing robes
of many colours; they were barefooted, their
small toes showing pleasantly pink and white
below the hems of their robes, and their arms
<a name="p188" id="p188"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>188<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>were drawn primly behind them. He watched
them. Although manifestly having no part in
the scene then being rehearsed for filming, they
continued to hold their arms in this restrained
and presumably uncomfortable attitude, as
though they might be practising some new form
of a deep-breathing exercise.</p>

<p>As he watched, one of the three, catching his
eye, arose and came padding her little bare feet
through the dust to where he stood.</p>

<p>“Do me a favour?” she inquired archly.</p>

<p>“Why&mdash;why, yes, certainly, if possible,”
answered Mr. Pilkins.</p>

<p>“Sure, it’s possible. See this?” She shook
her head, and a wayward ringlet which dangled
down against one cheek was agitated to and
fro across her pert face. “Well, it’s tickling
my nose something fierce. Tuck it back up
out of sight, will you?”</p>

<p>“I’m&mdash;I’m afraid I don’t understand,” stammered
Mr. Pilkins, jostled internally.</p>

<p>She turned slowly round, and he saw then
that her wrists were crossed behind her back
and firmly bound together with a length of
new cotton rope.</p>

<p>“I’m one of the captive Armenians,” she explained,
facing him again. “More’n a hour
ago Wagstaff&mdash;he’s the assistant director&mdash;he
tied us up. We gotta stay all tied up, just so,
till our scene goes on. He’s such a bug on all
them little details&mdash;Wagstaff is! Go on&mdash;be a
good fella and get this hair up out of my face,
<a name="p189" id="p189"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>189<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>won’t you? I’ll be sneezing my head off in another
minute. But say&mdash;mind the make-up.”</p>

<p>A brightish pink in colour, Mr. Pilkins extended
a helping hand, tingling inside of himself.</p>

<p>“Chester!”</p>

<p>It was his master’s voice, speaking with most
decided masterfulness. As though the errant
curl had been red-hot Mr. Pilkins jerked his
outstretched fingers back. The Armenian maiden
retired precipitately, her shoulders twitching.</p>

<p>“Chester, come here!”</p>

<p>Chester came, endeavouring, unsuccessfully,
to avoid all outward semblance of guilt.</p>

<p>“Chester, might I ask what you were doing
with that&mdash;that young person?” Mrs. Pilkins’
manner was ominous.</p>

<p>“I was helping her&mdash;a little&mdash;with her hair.”</p>

<p>“With her&mdash;why, what&mdash;do <span class="nw">you&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>“She is tied. Her hands, you know. &hellip;
<span class="nw">She&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>“Tied, is she?” Mrs. Pilkins bestowed a
chilled stare upon the retreating figure of the
captive. “Well, she deserves to be. They
should keep her tied. Chester, I want you to
stay close to me and not go wandering off
again.”</p>

<p>“Yes, my dear, I will&mdash;I mean, I won’t.”</p>

<p>“Besides, you may be needed any minute
now. Mr. Harcourt”&mdash;she indicated that gentleman,
who had approached&mdash;“has been kind
<a name="p190" id="p190"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>190<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>enough to invite us to take part in this beautiful
production.”</p>

<p>“But, my dear&mdash;<span class="nw">but&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>“Chester, I wish for my sake you would refrain
from keeping on saying ‘but.’ And please
quit interrupting.”</p>

<p>“You see&mdash;it’s like this,” explained Mr. Harcourt:
“It’s the scene at the dock when the
heroine gets home. You two are to be two of
the passengers&mdash;the director says he’ll be very
glad to have you take part. I just spoke to
him. There will be many others in the scene&mdash;extras,
you know. Think you’d like it? It will
be an experience.”</p>

<p>“As you say, Mr. Harcourt, it will be an experience,”
said Mrs. Pilkins. “I accept with
pleasure. So does my husband.”</p>

<p>Promptly ensued then action, and plenty of
it. With many others, recruited from the ranks
of the populace, the Chester Pilkinses were
herded into a corner of the open-faced stage
at the back side of the bazaar&mdash;a corner which
the two presiding genii of that domain, known
technically and respectively as the boss carpenter
and the head property man, had, by
virtue of their magic and in accordance with
an order from their overlord, the director, transformed,
even as one waited, from something
else into the pierhead of a New York dock.
With these same others our two friends mounted
a steep flight of steps behind the scenes, and
then, shoving sheeplike through a painted gangway,
<a name="p191" id="p191"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>191<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>in a painted bulkhead of a painted ship,
they flocked down across a canvas-sided gangplank
to the ostensible deck of the presumable
pier, defiling off from left to right out of lens
range, the while they smiled and waved fond
greetings to supposititious friends.</p>

<p>When they had been made to do this twice
and thrice, when divers stumbling individuals
among them had been corrected of a desire to
gaze, with the rapt, fascinated stare of sleep-walkers,
straight into the eye of the machine,
when the director was satisfied with his rehearsal,
he suddenly yelled “Camera!” and
started them at it all over again.</p>

<p>In this instant a spell laid hold on Chester
Pilkins. As one exalted he went through the
picture, doing his share and more than his share
to make it what a picture should be. For being
suddenly possessed with the instinct to act&mdash;an
instinct which belongs to all of us, but which
some of us after we have grown up manage to
repress&mdash;Chester acted. In his movements
there was the unstudied carelessness which is
best done when it is studied; in his fashion of
carrying his furled umbrella and his strapped
steamer rug&mdash;the Ziegler<!-- original reads 'Zeigler' --> Company had furnished
the steamer rug but the umbrella was
his own&mdash;there was natural grace; in his quick
start of recognition on beholding some dear
one in the imaginary throng waiting down on
the pier out of sight there was that art which
is the highest of all arts.</p>

<p><a name="p192" id="p192"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>192<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span>With your permission we shall skip the
orange groves, languishing through that day
for Mr. and Mrs. Chester K. Pilkins to come
and see them. We shall skip the San Francisco
Exposition. We shall skip the Yosemite Valley,
in which to Chester there seemed to be
something lacking, and the Big Trees, which
after all were much like other trees, excepting
these were larger. These things the travellers
saw within the scope of three weeks, and the
end of those three weeks and the half of a
fourth week brings them and us back to 373
Japonica Avenue. There daily Chester watched
the amusement columns of the <cite>Eagle</cite>.</p>

<p>On a Monday evening at seven-fifteen he
arrived home from the office, holding in his
hand a folded copy of that dependable sheet.</p>

<p>“Chester,” austerely said Mrs. Pilkins as he
let himself in at the door, “you are late, and
you have kept everything waiting. Hurry
through your dinner. We are going over to the
Lewinsohns for four-handed rummy and then
a rarebit.”</p>

<p>“Not to-night, Gertrude Maud,” said Chester.</p>

<p>“And why not to-night?” demanded the
lady with a rising inflection.</p>

<p>“Because,” said Chester, “to-night we are
going to the Bijou Palace Theatre. The Prince
of the Desert goes on to-night for the first
run.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” said Mrs. Pilkins understandingly.
<a name="p193" id="p193"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>193<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>“I’ll telephone Mrs. Lewinsohn we can’t come&mdash;make
some excuse or other. Yes, we’ll go
to the Bijou Palace.” She said this as though
the idea had been hers all along.</p>

<p>Seated in the darkened auditorium they
watched the play unfold upon the screen.
They watched while the hero, a noble son of
the Arabic sands, rescued the heroine, who was
daughter to a comedy missionary, from the
clutches of the wicked governor-general. They
saw the barefoot Armenian maids dragged by
mocking nomads across burning wastes to the
tented den of a villainous sheik, and in the
pinioned procession Chester recognised the
damsel of the truant curl and the ticklish nose.
They saw the intrepid and imperturbable American
correspondent as, unafraid, he stood in the
midst of carnage and slaughter, making notes
in a large leather-backed notebook such as all
newspaper correspondents are known to carry.
But on these stirring episodes Chester K. Pilkins
looked with but half an eye and less than
half his mind. He was waiting for something
else.</p>

<p>Eventually, at the end of Reel Four, his
waiting was rewarded, and he achieved the
ambition which all men bear within themselves,
but which only a few, comparatively speaking,
ever gratify&mdash;the yearning to see ourselves as
others see us. While the blood drummed in
his heated temples Chester Pilkins saw himself,
and he liked himself. I do not overstretch the
<a name="p194" id="p194"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>194<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>truth when I say that he liked himself first-rate.
And when, in the very midst of liking himself,
he reflected that elsewhere over the land, in
scores, perhaps in hundreds of places such as
this one, favoured thousands were seeing him
too&mdash;well, the thought was well-nigh overpowering.</p>


<p class="tb"><br class="ns"
 />For the succeeding three nights Mr. Pilkins’
fireside knew him not. The figure of speech
here employed is purely poetic, because, as a
matter of fact, the house was heated by steam.
But upon each of these three evenings he sat
in the Bijou Palace, waiting for that big moment
to come when he before his own eyes
should appear. Each night he discovered new
and pleasing details about himself&mdash;the set of
his head upon his shoulders, the swing of his
arm, the lift of his leg; each night, the performance
being ended, he came forth regarding
his fellow patrons compassionately, for they
were but the poor creatures who had made up
the audience, while he veritably had been not
only part of the audience but part of the entertainment
as well; each night he expected to be
recognised in the flesh by some emerging person
of a keen discernment of vision, but was
disappointed here; and each night he went
home at ten-forty-five and told Gertrude Maud
that business on the other side of the bridge
had detained him. She believed him. She&mdash;poor,
blinded wretch&mdash;did not see in his eyes
<a name="p195" id="p195"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>195<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>the flickering reflection of the spark of desire,
now fanning into a flame of resolution within
the brazier of his ribs.</p>

<p>Thursday night came, and The Prince of
the Desert film concluded its engagement at
the Bijou Palace. Friday night came, but
Chester K. Pilkins did not. He did not come
home that night nor the next day nor the next
night. Without warning to any one he had
vanished utterly, leaving behind no word of
whatsoever nature. He was gone, entirely and
completely gone, taking with him only the
garments in which he stood&mdash;a black cutaway,
black four-in-hand tie, black derby hat, plain
button shoes, plain, white, stiff-bosomed shirt.
I am quoting now from the description embodied
in a printed general alarm sent out by
the police department, which general alarm
went so far as to mention considerable bridge-work
in the upper jaw and a pair of fairly
prominent ears.</p>

<p>At last Chester K. Pilkins, although not present
to read what was printed of him, got into
the papers. Being questioned by reporters, his
late employers declared that the missing man
was of unimpeachable habits and that his accounts
were straight, and immediately then, in
a panic, set experts at work on his books. Remarkable
to state, his accounts were straight.
In the bank, in his wife’s name, he had left a
comfortable balance of savings. His small investments
were in order. They likewise were
<a name="p196" id="p196"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>196<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>found to be in his wife’s name; it seemed he
had sent a written order for their transfer on
the eve of his flight&mdash;if flight it was. The
house already was hers by virtue of a deed executed
years before. Discussing the nine-day
sensation, the ladies of the neighbourhood said
that even if Chester Pilkins had run away with
some brazen hussy or other, as to them seemed
most probable&mdash;because, you know, you never
can tell about these little quiet men&mdash;at least
he had left poor, dear Gertrude well provided
for, and that, of course, was something.</p>

<p>Something this may have been; but the deserted
wife mourned and was desolate. She
wanted Chester back; she was used to having
him round. He had been a good husband, as
husbands go&mdash;not exciting, perhaps, but good.
Despite strong evidences to the contrary, she
could not bring herself to believe that deliberately
he had abandoned her. He was dead,
by some tragic and violent means, or else he
had been kidnapped. Twice with a sinking
heart she accompanied a detective sergeant
from borough headquarters to the morgue, there
to gaze upon a poor relic of mortality which
had been fished out of the river, but which
bore no resemblance to her Chester nor, indeed,
to anything else that once had been human.
After this the police lost even a perfunctory
interest in the quest. But the lady
was not done. She paid a retainer to a private
detective agency having branches over the
<a name="p197" id="p197"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>197<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>country, and search was maintained in many
places, high and low.</p>

<p>Three months went by; then a fourth. Japonica
Avenue may have forgotten Chester
Pilkins, but Gertrude Maud had not. At the
tag end of the fourth month came tidings from
the main office of the detective agency which,
overnight, started Mrs. Pilkins to where&mdash;as
the passenger agents for the transcontinental
lines so aptly phrased it&mdash;California’s Golden
Strand is kissed by the pellucid waves of the
Sun-Down Sea. It couldn’t be true, this report
which had been brought to her by a representative
of the great sleuth for whom the
agency was named; indeed, it was inconceivable
to one who knew her husband that such a report
could be true, but she would make certain
for herself. She would&mdash;so this suffering, conscientious
woman told herself&mdash;leave no stone
unturned. She would neglect to follow up no clue
merely because of its manifest improbability.</p>

<p>So back she journeyed to that selfsame town
where the Ziegler studios were housed. A local
representative of the agency, being advised by
telegraph in advance of her coming, met her
at the station. Expressing physically the
gentle sympathy of an honorary pallbearer,
he led her to an automobile, and with her he
drove for miles through streets which she remembered
having traversed at least once before,
until in the far suburban reaches of the
city, where the blue foothills of the coast range
<a name="p198" id="p198"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>198<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>came down toward the sea, he brought her to
a centre of the moving-picture industry; not
the Ziegler establishment this time, but to the
curious place known as Filmville&mdash;ninety
fenced-in acres of seeming madness. It was
getting on toward five o’clock in the afternoon
when the automobile halted before its minareted
portals. Leaving Mrs. Pilkins in the car her
companion went to confer briefly with a uniformed
individual on duty at the door. Returning
to her he spoke as follows:</p>

<p>“The&mdash;ahem&mdash;the party we’ve got under
suspicion is out on location with a company.
But they’re due back here before dark. I guess
we’d better wait a spell.”</p>

<p>He helped her to alight, dismissed the automobile,
and accompanied her to an ornamental
seat facing an exceedingly ornamental fountain
which spouted in a grass plot hard by the gates
to Filmville. As she sat and waited, strangely
clad men and women&mdash;purporting to represent
in their attire many periods of the world’s
history and many remote corners of the world’s
surface&mdash;passed by, going in and out. From
over the high walls came to her jungle sounds
and jungle smells, for this large concern maintained
its own zoo upon its own premises.
Persistently a sacred cow of India, tethered in
a recess of the fence where herbage sprouted,
mooed for an absent mate. The voice of the
creature matched Mrs. Pilkins’ thoughts. Internally
she was mooing for her mate too.</p>

<p><a name="p199" id="p199"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>199<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span>Twilight impended when two automobile
loads of principals, attired cowboyishly and
cowgirlishly, came thumping out of the north
along the dusty road. These persons dismounted
and trooped inside. A little behind
them, heralded by a jingle of accoutrement,
came a dozen or so punchers riding ponies.
With jest and quip bandied back and forth,
and to the tinkling of their spurs, these last
dropped off their jaded mounts, leaving the
ponies to stand with drooping heads and dragging
bridles, and went clumping on their high
heels into a small wooden place, advertising
liquid refreshment, which stood across the way.
The detective softly joggled Mrs. Pilkins’ elbow.</p>

<p>“Come on, ma’am,” he said; “just follow
me. And don’t say anything until you’re sure.
And don’t scream or faint or anything like that&mdash;if
you can help it.”</p>

<p>“I shan’t,” said Mrs. Pilkins, all a-tremble.
She was resolved not to scream and she was
not the fainting kind.</p>

<p>Very naturally and very properly, as a gently
nurtured woman, Mrs. Pilkins had never seen
the interior of a barroom. From just inside
the swinging doors where her escort halted her
she looked about the place with the eye of
curiosity, and even though her mind swirled
tumultuously she comprehended it&mdash;the glassware,
the pictures on the walls, the short bar,
the affable dispenser who stood behind it, and
<a name="p200" id="p200"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>200<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>the row of cowboys who lined the front of it
from end to end, with their backs and hunched
shoulders all turned to her, stretching away in
a diminishing perspective.</p>

<p>“Wait a minute, lady,” advised the detective
in a whisper. “Take your time and look
’em over careful. And be sure&mdash;be sure to be
sure.”</p>

<p>The lady strove to obey. She looked and she
looked. At the back of the room three punchers
were clumped together, withdrawn slightly
from their fellows&mdash;a tall puncher, a medium-sized
puncher, and between these two a small
puncher.</p>

<p>“Here, ol’-timer,” bade the tall puncher,
drumming with his knuckles upon the bar,
“wait on fellers that a-got a real thirst. Three
long beers!”</p>

<p>The beers were drawn and placed at properly
spaced intervals before the three. Their three
right elbows rose at an angle; three flagons of
creamy brew vanished.</p>

<p>A fourth cowboy slid down toward them.</p>

<p>“Well,” he demanded boisterously, “how’s
Little Chestnut makin’ out? Still saddle sore?
Still hatin’ to think of the place where you got
to meet that there old paint pony of yourn to-mor’
mornin’?”</p>

<p>It was the tall cowboy who made answer.</p>

<p>“Nix on that Chestnut thing,” he said.
“That’s old stuff. You should a-seen the little
man stay by that pinto of hisn when she got
<a name="p201" id="p201"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>201<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>uptious a while ago&mdash;jist stay by her and pour
the leather into her. No, sir, that there Chestnut
stuff don’t go any more for this bunch.
This here”&mdash;and his long flannel-clad arm was
endearingly enwrapped about the shoulders of
his small companion&mdash;“this here boy from now
on is Old Chesty.”</p>

<p>Even though viewed from behind, it might
be seen that the person thus rechristened was
protruding a proud chest. With a little swagger
he breasted the bar.</p>

<p>“I’m buying,” he stated loudly. “Everybody’s
in on this one.”</p>

<p>“Whee!” yelled the big cowboy. “Chesty’s
buyin’&mdash;this one’s on Old Chesty.”</p>

<p>But another voice rose above his voice, over-topping
it&mdash;the cry of an agonised woman:</p>

<p>“Oh, Chester!”</p>

<p>As though he had been bee-stung the little
man pivoted on his heels. His chaps hung
floppingly about his short legs; his blue shirt
was open halfway down his sunburnt chest;
his pistol holster flapped against his flank; his
wide white hat was upon the back of his head;
his neck was tanned brown; his face was red
and sweaty; his large outstanding ears were
burnt a bright, translucent crimson; his hands
were dirty&mdash;but it was Chester. For one moment,
contemplating the accusing, brimming
eyes of the lady, he flinched and shrank as one
reared amid the refining influences of Japonica
Avenue under such circumstances as these
<a name="p202" id="p202"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>202<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>might well have flinched, might well have
shrunk. Then he stiffened and in all visible
regards was again Old Chesty, the roughrider.</p>

<p>“Hello, Gertrude,” he said, just like that.</p>

<p>“Oh, Chester!” she wailed the words in
louder key even than before.</p>

<p>Like the gentleman that he was, the barkeeper
turned squarely round and began polishing
the valve of a beer pump with the palm
of his moist hand. With a glance which swiftly
travelled from one to another the tall cowboy
gathered up his fellows and speedily they withdrew
through the swinging doors, passing the
lady with faces averted, profoundly actuated
all by considerations inspired of their delicate
outdoor sensibilities. Except for the detective
person, husband and wife, to all intents and
purposes, stood alone, face to face.</p>

<p>“Oh, Chester,” she repeated for the third
time, and now forgivingly her arms were outstretched.
“Oh, Chester, how could you do
it?”</p>

<p>“Do what, Gertrude?”</p>

<p>“Run away and l-l-leave me. What did you
do it for?”</p>

<p>“Three dollars a day,” he answered simply.
There was no flippancy in the reply, but
merely directness.</p>

<p>“Oh, Chester, to give up your home&mdash;your
position&mdash;me&mdash;for that! Oh, what madness
possessed you! Chester, come back home.”</p>

<p>“Back home to Brooklyn? Not on your
<a name="p203" id="p203"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>203<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>life.” His tone was firmness itself. He spoke
commandingly, as one who not only is master
of himself but of a present situation. “Gertrude,
you’d better stay here, too, now that
you’ve come. I guess maybe I could get ’em
to work you in on the regular list of extras.
You’d probably film well.” He eyed her appraisingly.</p>

<p>“But, oh, Chester, to go&mdash;as you went&mdash;with
never a word&mdash;never a line to me!”</p>

<p>“Gertrude, you wouldn’t have understood.
Don’t you see, honey, it’s like this.” He took
her in his arms, even as she had meant to take
him into hers, and, with small, comforting pats
upon her heaving back, sought to soothe her.
“It’s like this&mdash;I’m before the public now.
Why, Gerty, I’m in the eyes of the world.”</p>

 </span>CHAPTER VI<br
 /><span class="so">THE GREAT AUK</span></h2>


<p class="newchap"><span class="dropcap ml14">As</span> regards the body of the house it lay
mostly in shadows&mdash;the man-made,
daytime shadows which somehow always
seem denser and blacker than
those that come in the night. The little jogs
in the wall behind the boxes were just the same
as coalholes. The pitched front of the balcony
suggested a deformed upper jaw, biting down
on darkness. Its stucco facings, shining dimly,
like a row of teeth, added to the illusion. At
the bottom of the pit, or the family circle, or
whatever it was they called it at the Cosmos
Theatre, where the light was somewhat better,
the backs of the seats showed bumpily beneath
the white cloths that covered them, like lines
of graves in a pauper burying ground after a
snowstorm.</p>

<p>A third of the way back, in this potter’s field
of dead-and-gone laughter, a man was hunched
in a despondent posture. His attitude would
make you think of a lone ghost that had
<a name="p205" id="p205"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>205<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>answered the resurrection trump too soon and
now was overcome with embarrassment at having
been deceived by a false alarm. The brim
of his hat rested on the bridge of his nose.
Belonging, as he did, to a race that is esteemed
to be essentially commercial, he had the artistic
face and the imaginative eyes which, as often
as not, are found in those of his breed.</p>

<p>His name was Sam Verba. He was general
director for Cohalan &amp; Hymen, producing managers.
He was watching a rehearsal of a new
play, though he did not appear to be. Seemingly,
if he was interested in anything at all
it was in the movements of two elderly chore-women,
who dawdled about the place deliberatively,
with dust rags and brooms. Occasionally,
as one of the women raised her voice
shrilly to address her distant sister, he went
“Sh-h! Sh-h!”&mdash;like a defective steam pipe.
Following this the offender would lower her
voice for a space measurable by seconds.</p>

<p>Border lights, burning within the proscenium
arch, made the stage brightly visible, revealing
it as a thing homely and nude. Stage properties
were piled indiscriminately at either side.
Against the bare brick wall at the back, segments
of scenes were stacked any-which-way,
so that a strip of a drawing room set was superimposed
on a strip of a kitchen and that in
turn overlapped part of a wainscoted library,
the result being as though an earthquake had
come along and shaken one room of somebody’s
<a name="p206" id="p206"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>206<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>house into another room and that into another,
and then had left them so. In sight were four
women and nine men, who perched on chairs or
tables or roosted, crow-fashion, upon the iron
steps of a narrow staircase which ascended to
the top tier of dressing rooms, extending along
a narrow balcony above. The hour was eleven
o’clock in the morning. Therefore these persons
wore the injured look which people of their
nocturnal profession customarily wear upon
being summoned out of their beds before midday.</p>

<p>At a little table, teetering on rickety legs almost
in the trough of the footlights, sat a man
hostilely considering a typewritten script, which
was so interlined, so marked and disfigured with
crosses, stars, and erasures that only one person&mdash;the
author of these ciphers&mdash;might read his
own code and sometimes even he couldn’t. The
man at the table was the director, especially
engaged to put on this particular piece, which
was a comedy drama. He raised his head.</p>

<p>“All right, children,” he said, “take the second
act&mdash;from the beginning. Miss Cherry,
Mrs. Morehead&mdash;come along. Stand by, everybody
else, and, please, in Heaven’s name, remember
your cues&mdash;for once.”</p>

<p>A young woman and a middle-aged woman
detached themselves from one of the waiting
groups and came downstage. The young
woman moved eagerly to obey; she was an exceedingly
pretty young woman. The other
<a name="p207" id="p207"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>207<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>woman, having passed her youth, strove now
to re-create it in her costume. She wore a
floppy hat and a rather skimpy frock, which
buttoned down her back, school-girl fashion,
and ended several inches above her ankles.
Under the light her dyed hair shone with the
brilliancy of a new copper saucepan. There
were fine, puckery lines at her eyes. Her skin,
though, had the smooth texture which comes,
some say, from the grease paint, and others say
from plenty of sleep.</p>

<p>She held in one hand a flimsy, blue-backed
sheaf; it was her part in this play. Having
that wisdom in her calling which comes of long
experience, she would read from it until automatically
she had acquired it without prolonged
mental effort; would let her trained and docile
memory sop up the speeches by processes of
absorption. Miss Cherry carried no manuscript;
she didn’t need it. She had been sitting
up nights, studying her lines. For she, the poor
thing, was newly escaped from a dramatic
school. Mrs. Morehead wanted to make a
living. Miss Cherry wanted to make a hit.</p>

<p>These two began the opening scene of the
act and, between them, carried it forward.
Miss Cherry as the daughter, was playing it
in rehearsal, exactly as she expected to play it
before an audience, putting in gestures, inflections,
short catches of the breath, emotional
gasps&mdash;all the illusions, all the business of the
part. On the other hand, Mrs. Morehead
<a name="p208" id="p208"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>208<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>appeared to have but one ambition in her present
employment and that was to get it over with
as speedily as possible. After this contrasted
fashion, then, they progressed to a certain dramatic
juncture:</p>

<p>“But, mother,” said Miss Cherry, her arms
extended in a carefully-thought-out attitude of
girlish bewilderment, “what am I to do?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Morehead glanced down, refreshing her
memory by a glance into the blue booklet.</p>

<p>“My child,” she said, “leave it to destiny.”</p>

<p>She said this in the tone of a person of rather
indifferent appetite, ordering toast and tea for
breakfast.</p>

<p>A pause ensued here.</p>

<p>“My child,” repeated Mrs. Morehead, glancing
over her shoulder impatiently, but speaking
still in the same voice, “leave it to destiny.”</p>

<p>“Well, <span class="nw">well&mdash;&mdash;</span>” snapped the man at the
little table, “that’s the cue, ‘leave it to destiny.’
Come on, McVey? Come a-w-n, McVey?
Where’s McVey?” He raised his voice fretfully.</p>

<p>A nervous, thin man hurried down the stage.</p>

<p>“Oh, there you are. Go ahead, McVey.
You’re keeping everybody waiting. Didn’t I
tell you you’d have to read the grandfather’s
part to-day?”</p>

<p>“No, sir, you didn’t,” said McVey, aggrieved.</p>

<p>“Well, anyhow, I meant to,” said his superior.</p>

<p>“But I’m reading Miss Gifford’s part this
morning,” said McVey, who was the assistant
<a name="p209" id="p209"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>209<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>stage manager. “She had to go to see about
her costumes.”</p>

<p>“You’ll have to read ’em both, then,” ordered
the special director. “Anyhow, the parts
don’t conflict&mdash;they’re not on the stage together
during this act. Do the best you can.
Now let’s go back and take those last two
sides over again.”</p>

<p>Vibrantly and with the proper gesture in the
proper place, Miss Cherry repeated her speech.
Wearily and without gestures, Mrs. Morehead
repeated hers. The flustered McVey, holding
the absentee Miss Gifford’s part in one hand
and the mythical grandfather’s in the other,
circled upstage and, coming hurriedly down,
stepped in between them.</p>

<p>“No, no, no,” barked the director, “don’t
come on that way&mdash;you’ll throw both these
ladies out. Come on at the upper side of that
blue chair, Mac; that’s the door. This is supposed
to be a house. You can’t walk right
through the side of a house without upsetting
things. You realize that, don’t you? Once
more&mdash;back again to ‘leave it to destiny.’”</p>

<p>The rehearsal went on by the customary
process of advancing a foot and a half, then retreating
a foot, then re-advancing two feet.
The novices in the cast were prodigal of their
energy, but the veterans saved themselves
against what they knew was coming later, when
they would need all they had of strength and
more, besides.</p>

<p><a name="p210" id="p210"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>210<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span>A young man let himself in through the box-office
door and stood in that drafty, inky-black
space the theatrical folks call the front of the
house and the public call the back of the house.
Coming out of the sunlight into this cave of the
winds, he was blinded at first. He blinked
until he peered out the shape of Verba, slumped
down midway of a sheeted stretch of orchestra
chairs, and he felt his way down the centre
aisle and slipped into a place alongside the
silent, broody figure. The newcomer was the
author of the play, named Offutt; his age was
less than thirty; and his manner was cheerful,
as befitting an author who is less than thirty
and has placed a play with an established firm.</p>

<p>“Well,” he said, “how’s everything going?”</p>

<p>“Rotten, thank you!” said Verba, continuing
to stare straight ahead. “We’re still shy one
grandfather, if that should be of any interest
to you.”</p>

<p>“But you had Grainger engaged&mdash;I thought
that was all settled last night,” said the playwright.</p>

<p>“That tired business man? Huh!” said
Verba expressively. “By the time he’d got
through fussing over the style of contract he
wanted, in case he liked the part and we liked
him in it, and then quarrelling about the salary
he was to get, and then arguing out how high
up the list his name was to appear in the billing,
your friend Grainger was completely exhausted.</p>

<p>“And then, on top of that, he discovered we
<a name="p211" id="p211"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>211<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>were going to Chicago after the opening in
Rochester, and he balked. Said his following
was here in New York. Said he’d supposed we
were coming right in here after the opening instead
of fussing round on the road. Said he
couldn’t think of being kept out of New York
at the beginning of the season unless he got at
least seventy-five more a week. Said he’d go
back to vaudeville first. Said he had a swell
offer from the two-a-day shops anyhow.</p>

<p>“Then I said a few things to Grainger and
he walked out on me. His following!&mdash;do you
get that? Grainger could carry all the following
he’s got in the top of his hat and still have
plenty of room left for his head. So there you
are, my son&mdash;within ten days of the tryout and
nobody on hand to play dear old grandfather
for you! And nobody in sight either&mdash;in case
anybody should happen to ask you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, we’ll find somebody,” said Offutt optimistically.
The young of the playwrighting
species are constitutionally optimistic.</p>

<p>“Oh, we will, will we? Well, for example,
who?&mdash;since you’re so confident about it.”</p>

<p>“That’s up to you,” countered Offutt, “I
should worry!”</p>

<p>“Take it from me, young man, you’d better
worry,” growled Verba morosely.</p>

<p>“But, Verba,” contended Offutt, “there
must be somebody loose who’ll fit the part.
What with thousands of actors looking for <span class="nw">engagements&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p><a name="p212" id="p212"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>212<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span>“Say, Offutt, what’s the use of going over
that again?” broke in Verba in a tone which
indicated he was prepared to go over it again.
“To begin with, there aren’t thousands of actors
looking for jobs. There are a few actors looking
for jobs&mdash;and a few thousand others looking for
jobs who only think they can act. Offhand, I
can list you just three men fit to play this grandfather
part&mdash;or four, if you stick in Grainger as
an added starter.”</p>

<p>He held up a long, slender hand, ticking off
the names on his fingers.</p>

<p>“There’s Warburton, and there’s Pell, and
there’s old Gabe Clayton. Warburton’s tied
up in the pictures. Damn the movies! They’re
stealing everybody worth a hang. I got a swell
offer myself yesterday from the Ziegler crowd
to direct features for ’em. The letter’s on my
desk now. Old Gabe is in a sanitarium taking
the rest cure&mdash;which means for the time being
he’s practically sober, but not available for us
or anybody else. And Guy Pell’s under contract
to Fructer Brothers, and you know what a swell
chance there is of their loaning him to our
shop.</p>

<p>“That doesn’t leave anybody but Grainger,
who’s so swelled up with conceit that he’s impossible.
And, anyhow, he’s too young. Just
as I told you yesterday, I only figured him in
as a last chance. I don’t want a young fellow
playing this part&mdash;with his face all messed up
with false whiskers and an artificial squeak in
<a name="p213" id="p213"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>213<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>his voice. I want an old man&mdash;one that looks
old and talks old and can play old.</p>

<p>“He’s got to be right or nothing’s right. You
may have written this piece, boy; but, by gum,
I’m responsible for the way it’s cast, and I want
a regular, honest-to-God grandfather. Only,”
he added, quoting the tag of a current Broadway
story, “only there ain’t no such animal.”</p>

<p>“I still insist, Verba,” put in Offutt, “that
you overestimate the importance of the grandfather&mdash;he’s
only a character bit.”</p>

<p>“Son,” said Verba, “you talk like an author!
Maybe you thought he was a bit when you wrote
him in; but he’s not. He’s going to carry this
play. He’s the axle that the whole action turns
on and if he’s wrong the whole thing’s wrong.
If he falls down your play falls down.”</p>

<p>“Well, suppose he is,” said Offutt plaintively.
The bruised worm was beginning to turn.
“Am I to blame because I write a part so human
and so lifelike that nobody’s competent to do it?”</p>

<p>Verba gave him a sidelong glance and grinned
sardonically. “Don’t ask me whose fault it
is,” he said. “I know this: In the old days
actors were actors.” Verba, who was perhaps
forty-four, spoke with the air of having known
Edmund Kean intimately. “They bred real
artists then&mdash;people who had versatility and a
range. You got hold of a play and you went
out and hired a bunch of troupers, and they
played it for you. Now we don’t have actors
any more&mdash;we only have types.</p>

<p><a name="p214" id="p214"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>214<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span>“Everybody’s a type. A man or a woman
starts out being one kind of type, and sticks
right there. Dramatists write parts for types,
and managers go out and hire types for the
parts. Sometimes they can’t find the right
type and then there’s another expensive production
taking a trip to its eternal rest in the
storehouse. I don’t know whose fault it is&mdash;I
only know it’s not mine. It’s hell&mdash;that’s
what it is&mdash;simply hell!”</p>

<p>Gloom choked Verba. He stared moodily
ahead of him, where the broad of a wide, blue-ginghamed
back showed above the draped tops
of the next row of seats but one. Suddenly he
smote his hands together.</p>

<p>“Bateman!” he exclaimed. “Old Bird Bateman!”</p>

<p>Up from behind the next row of seats but
one rose a chorelady with her nose in the air
and her clenched fists on the places where her
hips should have been&mdash;if she had any hips.</p>

<p>“I beg your par-r-don?” she inquired, quivering
with a grand, indignant politeness; “was
you referrin’ to me as an ould boid?”</p>

<p>“Madam,” said Verba, “resume your pleasures.
I wasn’t thinking of you.”</p>

<p>“Thin why was you lookin’ at me whin you
said it? You may be the owner of this bum
dump, f’r all I care, but job or no job, let me
tell you this, young man&mdash;there’s no black
Prowtestant Jew alive kin call me out of me
own name <span class="nw">an’&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p><a name="p215" id="p215"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>215<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span>“Oh, shut up,” said Verba, without heat.
He got on his feet. “Come on, Offutt, the lady
thinks I’m trying to flirt with her and between
the three of us, we’re breaking up rehearsals.
Let’s get out&mdash;I’ve got an idea.” In the half
light his eyes shone like a cat’s.</p>

<p>Outside, on the hot pavement, he took Offutt
by the lapels of his coat. “Boy,” he said, “did
you ever hear of Burton Bateman&mdash;better
known as Old Bird Bateman?”</p>

<p>Offutt shook his head.</p>

<p>“Never did,” he confessed.</p>

<p>“You’re too young at this game to remember,
I guess,” said Verba. “Well, then, did
you ever hear of the Scudder Stock Company?”</p>

<p>“Of course I’ve heard of that,” said Offutt.
“It was long before my time though.”</p>

<p>“It was long before everybody’s time,” assented
Verba. “Ten years is the same as a century
on this street. But twenty-five years ago
Burt Bateman played leads with the Scudder
Stock Company&mdash;yes; and played juveniles and
walking gentlemen and friends of the family
and long-lost heirs and Dutchmen and Irishmen
and niggers&mdash;played high-comedy parts and
low-comedy parts&mdash;played anything there was
to play.</p>

<p>“He wasn’t one of your single-barrelled modern
types and none of your old-time ranting
scenery-biters either; he was an actor. If he’d
come along a little later they’d have made a
<a name="p216" id="p216"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>216<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>star out of him and probably ruined him. You’d
have remembered him then. But he never was
a star. He never was featured even. He just
kept right on being an actor. And gee, how
he could eat up an old man’s part!”</p>

<p>“You speak of him as though he were dead,”
said Offutt.</p>

<p>“He might as well be&mdash;he’s forgotten,” said
Verba, unconsciously coining all Broadway’s
epitaph for all Broadway’s tribe. “I haven’t
seen him for fifteen years, but I understand he’s
still alive&mdash;that is, he hasn’t quit breathing.
Somebody was telling me not long ago they’d
crossed his trail ’way downtown.</p>

<p>“You see, Burt Bateman was a character in
his way, just as old Nate Scudder was one in
his way. I guess that’s why they hung together
so long. When the theatrical district started
to move uptown Nate wouldn’t move with it.
It moved from Fourteenth Street to Twenty-third,
and from there to Thirty-fourth, and
from there to Forty-second&mdash;and it’s still
headed north. But Scudder stayed where he
was. And it broke him&mdash;broke his heart, too,
I guess. Anyhow, he died and his organisation
scattered&mdash;all but Bateman. He wouldn’t
scatter. The heirs fell out and the estate&mdash;what
was left of it&mdash;got tied up in litigation;
and it’s been tied up ever since.”</p>

<p>He turned and waved a long arm at a passing
taxi. The driver curved his machine up to the
curb.</p>

<p><a name="p217" id="p217"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>217<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span>“Come on!” said Verba, making to cross the
sidewalk.</p>

<p>“Come on where?” asked Offutt.</p>

<p>“We’re going to University Place&mdash;you and
me,” said Verba, quickened and alive all over
with his inspiration. “We’re going down to
Scudder’s Theatre. Didn’t know there was
such a theatre as Scudder’s, did you? Well,
there is&mdash;what’s left of it. We’re going down
there to find Old Bird Bateman. That’s where
he was, last accounts. And if the booze hasn’t
got him he’s going to play that damn grandfather
in this show of yours.”</p>

<p>“Can he do it?”</p>

<p>Verba halted with one foot in the taxi.</p>

<p>“Can he do it? Watch him, boy&mdash;that’s all!
Just watch him. Say, it’s a notion&mdash;digging
that old boy out of the graveyard.</p>

<p>“You never heard of him and I’d forgotten
him; but you take a lot of these old-timers who
don’t think there’ve been any actors since Fanny
Davenport and Billy Florence&mdash;they’ll remember
him. And you bet they’ll come to see him.
We’ll give this town a sensation&mdash;and that’s
what it loves, this town&mdash;sensations.”</p>

<p>Once upon a time&mdash;that was when he was a
green reporter newly come to town&mdash;Offutt
had known, more or less minutely, almost every
prowlable inch of the tip of the long seamy
tongue of rock that is called Manhattan Island.
Now, as a story-writer and a play-writer, he
only went down there when he sought for local
<a name="p218" id="p218"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>218<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>colour in Greenwich Village, or around Washington
Square or on the lower East Side. As
for Verba, he found his local colour, ready-mixed,
in scene-painters’ pots and make-up
boxes. Being a typical New Yorker&mdash;if there
is such a thing&mdash;he was as insular, as provincial,
as closely bound to his own briefened ranging
ground as none but a typical New Yorker can
be. To him this wasn’t a metropolis of five
boroughs, many bridges and five-and-a-half
millions. To him this was a strip of street,
something less than two miles long, with
shorter stretches of street meeting it at right
angles, east and west, as ribs meet a spine.
His map of New<!-- original reads 'New New' --> York would have resembled
a codfish’s skeleton, its head aiming toward
far-away Harlem, the fork in its tail pointing
to the distant Battery. To him therefore
Twenty-third Street was Farthest South. What
might lie below was in the Antarctic Circle of
community life.</p>

<p>They crossed Twenty-third Street and invaded
a district grown strange to his eyes&mdash;a
district where tall loft buildings, the successors
to the sweatshops of an earlier, but not very
much earlier, day, mounted, floor by floor,
above the humbler roofs of older houses. They
crossed Fourteenth, the taxi weaving a way
through dense masses of men who gabbled in
strange tongues among themselves, for lunch-time
had come and the garment workers, the
feather-workers and the fur-workers, deserting
<a name="p219" id="p219"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>219<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>their work benches for an hour, had flocked
into the open, packing the sidewalks and overflowing
upon the asphalt, to chaffer and gossip
and take the air. Just below Fourteenth Street
they swung eastward and turned into University
Place, which is a street of past memories
and present acute activities, and, in a minute,
obeying Verba’s instructions, their driver
brought them to a standstill before a certain
number.</p>

<p>“Give it the once-over,” advised Verba as he
climbed out and felt in his pocket for the fare.
“You can figure for yourself how far out of the
world it is&mdash;nobody’s had the nerve to try to
open it up as a moving-picture palace. And
that’s the tip-off on any shack in this burg
that’ll hold a crowd, a screen and a projecting
machine all at the same time.”</p>

<p>Offutt looked, and marvelled that he had
never noticed this place before since surely,
covering assignments or on exploration jaunts,
he must have passed it by a score of times. It
stood midway of the block. On one side of it
was a little pawnshop, its single grimy window
filled with the strange objects which persons
acquire, seemingly, for pawning purposes exclusively&mdash;sword-canes
and mandolins with
mother-of-pearl insets in them, and moss-agate
cuff buttons. On the other side was a trunk
store with half of its wares cluttering the narrow-door
passage and signs everywhere displayed
to inform the public that the proprietor
<a name="p220" id="p220"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>220<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>was going out of business and must sell his
stock at an enormous sacrifice, wherefore until
further notice, perfectly ruinous prices would
prevail. It appears to be a characteristic of all
trunk-stores that their proprietors are constantly
going out of business and that their
contents, invariably, are to be had below cost.</p>

<p>Between these two establishments gaped a
recessed and cavernous entryway flanked by
two big stone pillars of a dropsical contour and
spanned over at the top by a top-heavy cornice
ponderously and painfully Corinthian in aspect.
The outjutting eaves rested flat on the coping
stones and from there the roof gabled up sharply.
Old gates, heavily chained and slanting inward,
warded the opening between the pair of pillars,
so that the mouth of the place was muzzled
with iron, like an Elizabethan shrew’s.</p>

<p>Above, the building was beetle-browed; below,
it was dish-faced. A student of architectural
criminology would pause before this
facade and take notes.</p>

<p>The space inclosed within the skewed and
bent gate pickets was a snug harbour for the
dust of many a gritty day. There were little
grey drifts of it at the foot of each of the five
steps that led up to the flagged floor level; secretions
of grime covered the barred double doors
on beyond the steps, until the original colour
was only to be guessed at; scraps of dodgers,
pieces of newspaper and tattered handbills adhered
to every carved projection at the feet of
<a name="p221" id="p221"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>221<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>the columns, like dead leaves about tree boles
in the woods.</p>

<p>On the frieze overhead might be made out,
in lettering that once had been gold-leafed, the
line: Scudder’s Family Theatre. The words
were scarcely decipherable now. Bill-posters
had coated every available inch of space with
snipes and sheets.</p>

<p>Verba shook the gates until the hasps gritted
and the chains clanged.</p>

<p>“Nobody at home,” he said. “I guess the
sheriff locked her up when the lawsuits started
and then threw away the key. Well, let’s scout
round. Somebody’s sure to know our man;
they told me Bateman was a neighbourhood
character down here. A cop ought to be able
to help us&mdash;only I don’t see one. Maybe they
don’t have cops in this street.”</p>

<p>Speculatively his eyes ranged the vista up
and down the block and opposite. He pointed
to a saloon diagonally across the way, next
door to the first corner south.</p>

<p>“When in doubt,” he said, “ask everybody’s
friend. Come on; we’ll go over and brace the
barkeep.”</p>

<p>A young man, with a humorous slant to his
eyebrows and dark hair combed back from the
forehead in neatly ornate scallops, pulled down
the front of a reasonably clean white jacket
and spread both hands on the bar, awaiting
their pleasure.</p>

<p>“Mister Wine Clerk,” said Verba, using the
<a name="p222" id="p222"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>222<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>ceremonial title of his Tenderloin range, “we’re
trying to find an old boy named Bateman&mdash;Burton
Bateman, retired actor by profession.
Ever hear of him?”</p>

<p>“Sure!” assented the barkeeper. “He’s part
of the fixtures&mdash;Old Bird is; but he ain’t about
now. To ketch him, you’ve come an hour late.”</p>

<p>“Lives round here somewhere, doesn’t he?”</p>

<p>“Search me,” said the young man succinctly.
“I guess he don’t exactly live anywhere&mdash;not
in a regular lodging house or anything like that.
See? I never asked him&mdash;him being sort of
touchy about his private affairs&mdash;but I guess
he sleeps in some hole somewhere. He mostly
does his scoffin’ here though&mdash;as a guest of the
house.”</p>

<p>“Does his what here?” asked Verba.</p>

<p>“His scoffin’&mdash;his feedin’. See?” The young
man flirted a thumb in the direction of the free-lunch
counter.</p>

<p>“Oh! He eats here?”</p>

<p>“You said it! The boss&mdash;man that owns this
liquor store&mdash;is a kind of an old-timer round
here himself. I’ve heard him say he knowed
The Bird away back yonder when the old theatre
’crost the street was runnin’ and things was
breakin’ better for the old boy than what they
do now. So he stakes him to a drink every now
and then&mdash;Old Bird won’t take a piece of change,
but he will take a drink&mdash;and he lets him browse
off the free lunch all he’s a mind to.</p>

<p>“He comes driftin’ in here twicet a day
<a name="p223" id="p223"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>223<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>regular and fills up on chow for nothin’! But he’s
been here already and left to-day&mdash;’bout an
hour ago. I figure he won’t be back now till
’long about four or five o’clock.”</p>

<p>Verba became cognisant of a tugging at his
coat. An incredibly small, incredibly ragged
boy, with some draggled first editions under his
arm, had wormed silently in between his legs
and was looking up at him with one eye. The
boy had only one eye to look with. The other
eye was a flattened slit over a sunken socket.</p>

<p>“Mister! Say, Mister!” beseeched the gamin
earnestly. “Gimme fi’ cent and <span class="nw">I’ll&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>“Hey, you, Blinky!” interposed the barkeeper,
bending over the bar to see the small
intruder. “Beat it!”</p>

<p>There was a scurrying thud of bare feet on
the tiled floor and the wizened intruder magically
had vanished between the swinging doors.</p>

<p>“You gents can sit down and wait if you
want to,” said the barkeeper. “It’s liable to
be a long time though. Or I can tell Old Bird,
when he comes in, somebody’s askin’ for him
and try to hold him for you. I could phone you
even, if it’s important&mdash;if you’ll gimme your
number.”</p>

<p>“It is important&mdash;in a way,” said Verba.
“Suppose we do that, Offutt&mdash;give the wine
clerk our telephone number.”</p>

<p>He laid a coin and a card on the bar. The
young man regarded the name and the address
on the card briefly.</p>

<p><a name="p224" id="p224"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>224<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span>“All right!” he said, depositing the coin in
his pocket and the card against the mirror at
his back. “I won’t forget. The old boy don’t
have many people lookin’ for him. Fact is, I
don’t remember he ever had anybody lookin’
for him before. Are you gents friends of his? &hellip; No?
Well, anyhow, I’ll fix it.”</p>

<p>“Funny old sneezer!” he continued. “Dippy
a little up here, I guess.”</p>

<p>He tapped himself on the forehead.</p>

<p>“If he had a habit I’d say sometimes he was
hopped. F’r instance, he’ll come in here and
spiel off something to me ’bout havin’ been in
his Louie Kahn’s drawin’-room&mdash;anyhow, that’s
what it sounds like. The only Louie Kahn
round here that I know of runs a junk shop
over in Ninth Street. And it’s a cinch that
Louie Kahn ain’t got no drawin’-room. Or
he’ll tell me he’s been spendin’ the day on the
seabeach. Only yes’day he was handin’ me
that junk.”</p>

<p>“Mightn’t he have taken a little run down to
Coney?” suggested Verba hopefully.</p>

<p>“Go to Coney&mdash;him!” scoffed the barkeeper.
“Where’d he raise the coin for carfare down to
Coney? You can take it from me, gents, Old
Bird forgot what the sad sea waves sound like,
long time ago. I’ll lay you a little eight-to-five
he ain’t been a quarter of a mile away from
this liquor store in ten years. &hellip; Well, good
day, gents.”</p>

<p>“It strikes me, Verba,” began Offutt as they
<a name="p225" id="p225"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>225<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>passed out, “that possibly we’re only wasting
our time. If what that gabby young drink
wrestler just said is right <span class="nw">we’re&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>Something wriggled at his knees and caromed
off against Verba. A single bright, greedy eye
appraised them with an upward flash.</p>

<p>“Mister! Mister, listen!” pleaded a voice,
the owner of which managed somehow to be in
the path of both of them at once. “I heard
yous spielin’ in there. I know where Old Boid
is. I kin show yous where he is.”</p>

<p>“Where is he?” demanded Verba.</p>

<p>“Gimme fi’ cent&mdash;gimme ten cent&mdash;first. It’s
a secrut. It’s worth ten cent.”</p>

<p>“It is,” agreed Verba gravely. “It’s worth
all of ten cents now and it’ll be worth a quarter
more to you, sonny, if you deliver the
goods.”</p>

<p>He tendered the advance instalment of the
fee and a hand, all claws like a bird’s foot,
snatched it away from him.</p>

<p>Blinky carefully pouched the dime in some
unfathomable inner recess of his rags. Having
provided against any attempt to separate him
from the retainer in the event of the negotiations
falling through, his code of honour asserted
itself.</p>

<p>“It’s a secrut. See? They ain’t nobody but
me and two-t’ree udder kids wise to it. Yous
gotta swear yous won’t tell ’im nor nobody
’twas me tipped yous off. If yous did it’d spoil
me graft&mdash;he’d be sore. See? Cold nights he
<a name="p226" id="p226"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>226<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>lets us kids bunk in there wit’ ’im. And daytimes
we plays audiunce for ’im. See?”</p>

<p>“You play what for him?” asked Offutt.</p>

<p>“C’m on, an’ I’ll show yous,” bade Blinky.
“Only yous is gotta lay dead w’ile it’s comin’
off. See?”</p>

<p>“We’ll lay dead,” pledged Verba.</p>

<p>Satisfied, Blinky led the way. Mystified, they
followed. He led them back across University
Place again; and on past Scudder’s Family Theatre,
with the lowering stone frontal bone above
and, below, the wide maw, bitted and gagged
by its scold’s bridle of snaffled iron; and on
round the corner below into a fouled, dingy
cross street.</p>

<p>Beyond the canvas marquee of a small walled-in
beer garden the child went nimbly through
a broken panel in a short stretch of aged and
tottery wooden fencing. Wriggling through the
gap behind him they found themselves in a
small inclosure paved with cracked flagging.
Confronting them was a short flight of iron
steps, leading up to a wide, venerable-appearing
doorway, which once, as the visible proof
showed, had been sealed up with plank shorings,
nailed on in vertical strips.</p>

<p>“One of the old side entrances to Scudder’s,”
said Verba. “Where the carriages used to
wait, I guess. The plot thickens&mdash;eh, Offutt?”</p>

<p>Offutt nodded, his eyes being on their small
guide. A little sense of adventure possessed
<a name="p227" id="p227"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>227<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>them both. They had the feeling of being co-conspirators
in a little intrigue.</p>

<p>“Wotcher waitin’ fur?” demanded Blinky.
“Stick wit’ me and don’t make no noise.” He
climbed the iron steps and shoved the nail-pocked
door ajar. “Watch yer step!” he counselled
as he vanished within. “It’s kind o’
dark in yere.”</p>

<p>Kind o’ dark was right. Straining their
eyes they stumbled along a black passage,
with Blinky going on ahead silently. They
turned once to the left and once to the right
and emerged, where the light was somewhat
clearer, into the shelter of a recess just behind
the lower boxes of the abandoned playhouse.</p>

<p>“Wow!” said Verba in a sort of reverential
undertone, as though he stood in the presence
of death. “I haven’t been here in twenty-odd
years. Why, the last time I was here I was a
kid!”</p>

<p>Veritably he did stand in the presence of
death. The place looked dead and smelled
dead and was dead. The air was heavy-laden
with bone-yard scents&mdash;rot and corrosion and
rust and dust. With the taints of moulded
leather and gangrened metal, of worm-gnawed
woodwork and moth-eaten fabrics, arose also
from beneath their feet that other stench which
inevitably is begotten of neglect and lonesomeness
within any spot inclosed by walls and a
roof, provided sun and wind and human usage
are excluded from it long enough. Offutt sniffed
<a name="p228" id="p228"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>228<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>and, over Verba’s shoulder, looked about
him.</p>

<p>He could make out his immediate surroundings
fairly well, for the curtains that had guarded
the windows in the hip roof and round one
upper side of the building were turned by decay
into squares of lace-work, patterned with rents
and with cracks; and in some instances they had
fetched away from their fastenings altogether.</p>

<p>Through the glass panes, and through the
grime that bleared the glass, a measure of daylight
filtered, slanting in pale bluish streaks,
like spilt skim milk; on vistas of the faded red-plush
chairs; on the scrolled and burdened decorations
of the proscenium arch; on the seamy,
stained curtain; on the torn and musty hangings
of the boxes; on an enormous gas chandelier
which, swinging low over the pit from the
domed ceiling above, was so clumped with
swathings of cobweb that it had become a
great, dangling grey cocoon.</p>

<p>Curving in wide swings from above their
heads to the opposite side ran three balconies,
rising one above the other, and each supported
by many fat pillars. The spaces beneath these
galleries were shadowy and dark, seeming to
stretch away endlessly. So, too, was the perspective
of the lower floor, at the back, elaborated
by the gloom into a vast, yawning mouth
which fairly ached with its own emptiness.
But at the front the screened angles of sunlight,
stippled as they were with billions of dancing
<a name="p229" id="p229"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>229<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>motes, brought out clearly enough the stage of
the old theatre and, down under the lip of the
stage, the railed inclosure of the orchestra and,
at either side, the scarred bulkheads and fouled
drapings of the stage boxes, upper tier and
lower tier.</p>

<p>Close at hand Offutt was aware of crawling
things which might be spiders, and a long grey
rat which scuffled across the floor almost beneath
his feet, dragging its scaled tail over the
boards with a nasty rasping sound. He heard
other rats squealing and gnawing in the wainscoting
behind him. He was aware, also, of the
dirt, which scabbed and crusted everything.
And he felt as though he had invaded the vault
of an ancient tomb. Sure enough, in a manner
of speaking, he had done just that.</p>

<p>“Some place&mdash;huh, mister?” said the small
gutter-sparrow proudly, and, though he spoke
in a whisper, Offutt jumped. “Stick yere, yous
two,” ordered the child. “Somethin’ll be comin’
off in a minute.”</p>

<p>Seemingly he had caught a signal or a warning
not visible to the older intruders. Leaving
them, he ran briskly down a side aisle, and apparently
did not care now how much noise he
might make, for he whooped as he ran. He
flung his papers aside and perched himself in a
chair at the very front of the pit. He briskly
rattled the loose back of the chair in front of
him, and, inserting two dirty fingers at the corners
of his mouth, emitted the shrill whistle
<a name="p230" id="p230"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>230<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>by which a gallery god, since first gallery gods
were created into an echoing world, has testified
to his impatient longings that amusement
be vouchsafed him.</p>

<p>As though the whistle had been a command,
the daubed old curtain shivered and swayed.
A dead thing was coming to life. Creaking
dolefully, it rolled up and up until it had rolled
up entirely out of sight.</p>

<p>A back drop, lowered at a point well down
front, made the stage shallow. Once upon a
time this back drop had been intended to represent
a stretch of beach with blue rollers
breaking on beyond. Faded as it was, and
stained and cracked and scaly as it was now,
the design of the artist who painted it was yet
discernible; for he plainly had been one who
held by the pigmented principle that all sea
sands be very yellow and all sea waves be very
blue.</p>

<p>Out of the far wings came a figure of a man,
crossing the narrowed space to halt midway of
the stage, close up to the tin gutter where the
tipless prongs of many gas-jet footlights stood
up like the tines in a garden rake. Verba’s hand
tightened on Offutt’s arm, dragging him farther
back into the shadows, and Verba’s voice spoke,
with a soft, tense caution, in Offutt’s ear:
“Lord! Lord!” Verba almost breathed the
words out. “‘Backward, turn backward, O
Time, in <span class="nw">your&mdash;&mdash;</span>’ Look yonder, Offutt! It’s
him!”</p>

<p><a name="p231" id="p231"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>231<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span>He might have spared the urging. Offutt
was looking and, without being told, knew the
man at whom he looked was the man the two
of them had come here to find. The lone
gamin in the pit clapped his talons of hands together,
making a feeble, thin sound. To this
applause, as to a rousing greeting, the figure
behind the footlights bowed low, then straightened.
And Offutt could see, by one of the
slanting bars of tarnished daylight, which
stabbed downward through the dusk of the
place, that the man up there on the stage was
a very old man, with a heavy, leonine face and
heavy brows and deep-set, big grey eyes, and
a splendid massive head mopped with long,
coarse white hair; and he was dressed as
a fop of sixty years ago and he carried himself
so.</p>

<p>The slash of indifferent sunshine, slicing into
the gloom like a dulled sword blade, rested its
lowermost tip full upon him. It brought out
the bleached pallor of his skin, for his face was
free from any suggestion of make-up, and it
showed the tears and frays in his costume, and
the misshapen shoes that were on his feet, and
the high-shouldered, long-tailed coat and the
soiled, collarless shirt which he wore beneath
the once gorgeous velvet waistcoat.</p>

<p>In one hand he held, by a dainty grip on the
brim, a flat-crowned derby hat, and between
the fingers of the other hand twirled a slender
black walking stick, with the shreds of a silken
<a name="p232" id="p232"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>232<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>tassel adhering to it. And everything about
him, barring only the shoes and the shirt, which
plainly belonged to his everyday apparel,
seemed fit to fall apart with age and with shabbiness.</p>

<p>“Ladies and gentlemen,” he said&mdash;and his
voice filled all the empty house by reason of
its strength and its toned richness&mdash;“with your
kind indulgence I shall begin this entertainment
with an attempt at an imitation of the elder
Sothern in his famous rôle of Lord Dundreary,
depicting him as he appeared in one of the
scenes from that sterling and popular comedy,
Our American Cousin, by Tom Taylor, Esquire.”</p>

<p>With that, instantly stepping into character,
he took a mincing, jaunty pace or two sideways.
Half turning toward an imaginary confrère
and addressing that mythical listener, he
began a speech which, being pieced together
with other speeches, at once lengthened into a
kind of monologue. But he knew the lines&mdash;that
was plain; and he knew the part, too, and
for the moment lived and breathed it, and in
all regards veritably was it. That, likewise, the
watching pair of eavesdroppers could realise,
though neither of them was of sufficient age to
remember, even had he seen, the great craftsman
whose work old Bateman now was counterfeiting.</p>

<p>The interlopers looked on and, under the
spell of a wizardry, forgot indeed they were
<a name="p233" id="p233"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>233<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>interlopers. For before their eyes they saw,
wonderfully re-created, a most notable conception,
and afterward would have sworn, both of
them, that all of it&mdash;the drawl and the lisp, the
exaggerated walk, the gestures, the play of leg
and arm, the swing of body, the skew of head,
the lift of eyebrow even&mdash;was as true and as
faithful to the original as any mirrored image
might be to the image itself.</p>

<p>How long they stood and watched neither
Verba nor Offutt was subsequently able to say
with any reasonable exactitude. It might have
been four minutes; it might have been six, or
even eight. When later, taking counsel together,
they sought to reckon up the time, the
estimates varied so widely they gave up trying
to reconcile them.</p>

<p>This much, though, they were sure of&mdash;that,
in his mumming, old Bateman rose magically
triumphant above the abundant handicaps of
his own years and his own physique, his garb
and his environment. Doing the undoable, he
for the moment threw aside his years as one
might throw aside the weight of a worn-out
garment, and for that moment, to suit his own
designs of mimicry, made floods of strength
and youthfulness course through those withered
arteries.</p>

<p>The old man finished with a whimsical turn
of his voice and a flirt of his cane to match it.
He bowed himself off with the hand which held
the hat at his breast, and promptly on the
<a name="p234" id="p234"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>234<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>second he disappeared the ancient curtain began
to descend, Blinky meanwhile clapping with
all his puny might.</p>

<p>Offutt turned to his companion. Behind the
shelter of the box Verba’s lean, dark face was
twitching.</p>

<p>“Is he there? Can he act? Was I right?”
Verba asked himself each question, and himself
answered each with a little earnest nod. “Gee,
what a find!”</p>

<p>“Not a find, Verba,” whispered Offutt&mdash;“a
resurrection&mdash;maybe. We’ve seen a genius in
his grave.”</p>

<p>“And we’re going to dig him up.” In his
intentness Verba almost panted it. “Wait!
Wait!” he added warningly then, though Offutt
had not offered to stir. “This is going to be a
Protean stunt, I take it. Let’s let him show
some more of his goods; for, by everything
that’s holy, he’s got ’em!”</p>

<p>Up once more the curtain lifted, seemingly
by its own motive power; and now the seaside
drop was raised, and they beheld that, behind
it, the stage had been dressed for another scene&mdash;a
room in a French house. A secrétaire, sadly
battered and marred, stood at one side; a bookcase
with broken doors and gaping, empty
shelves stood at the other, balancing it off.
Down stage was an armchair. Its tapestry
upholstering was rotted through and a freed
spiral of springs upcoiled like a slender snake
from its cushioned seat. All three pieces were
<a name="p235" id="p235"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>235<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>of a pattern&mdash;“Louie-the-Something stuff,”
Verba would have called them.</p>

<p>A table, placed fronting the chair but much
nearer the right lower entrance than the chair
was, and covered with a faded cloth that depended
almost to the floor, belonged evidently
to the same set. The scenery at the back
showed a balcony, with a wide French window,
open, in the middle. Beyond the window dangled
a drop, dingy and discoloured as all the
rest was, but displaying dimly a jumble of
painted housetops and, far away in the simulated
distance, the Arc de Triomphe. The
colours were almost obliterated, but the suggestion
of perspective remained, testifying still to
the skill of the creator.</p>

<p>From the wings where they had seen him
vanish Bateman reappeared. The trousers and
the shoes were those he had worn before; but
now, thrown on over his shirt, was the melancholy
wreck of what once had been a blue uniform
coat, with huge epaulets upon the shoulders
and gold braid upon the collar and the
cuffs, and brass buttons to fasten it in double-breasted
fashion down the front. Now, though,
it hung open. Some of the buttons were missing,
and the gold lacings were mere blackened
wisps of rags.</p>

<p>Bateman came on slowly, with dragging feet,
his arms and legs and head quivering in a violent
palsy. He stared out of the window as he
let himself down carefully into the ruined
<a name="p236" id="p236"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>236<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>armchair. His first movement proved that he
played a venerable, very decrepit man&mdash;a man
near death from age and ailments; yet by his
art he managed to project, through the fleshly
and physical weaknesses of the character, a
power of dignity, of dominance, and of mental
authority. He rolled his head back weakly.</p>

<p>“‘My child,’” he said, addressing a make-believe
shape before him, “‘I must help to receive
our brave, victorious troops. See! I am
fittingly dressed to do them honour.’”</p>

<p>His tones were pitched in the cracked cackle
of senility. He paused, as though for an answer
out of space. His inflection told as he, in turn,
replied that this answer had been a remonstrance:</p>

<p>“‘No, no, no!’” he said almost fiercely.
“‘You must not seek to dissuade me.’”</p>

<p>The words stung Verba’s memory, raising a
welt of recollection there.</p>

<p>“I’ve got it!” he said exultantly, not forgetting,
though, to keep his voice down. “Siege
of Berlin, by that French fellow&mdash;what’s his
name?&mdash;Daudet!”</p>

<p>“I remember the story,” answered Offutt.</p>

<p>“I remember the play,” said Verba. “Somebody
dramatised it&mdash;Lord knows who&mdash;and
Scudder put it on here as a curtain raiser. I
saw it myself, Offutt&mdash;think of that! Sitting
up yonder in the old peanut roost&mdash;a kid no
bigger than that kid down there&mdash;I saw it.
And now I’m seeing it again; seeing Burt Bateman
<a name="p237" id="p237"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>237<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>play the part of the old paralytic&mdash;you
know, the old French officer who was fooled by
his doctor and his granddaughter into believing
the French had licked the Germans, when all
the time ’twas the other way <span class="nw">and&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>“Sh-h!” counselled Offutt.</p>

<p>After another little wait Bateman was going
on with his scene:</p>

<p>“‘Listen! Listen!’” he cried, cupping a
tremulous palm behind his ear. “‘Do you not
hear them far away?&mdash;the trumpets&mdash;the trumpets
of victorious France! Our forces have entered
Berlin! Thank God! Thank God! All
Paris will celebrate. I must greet them from
the balcony.’”</p>

<p>With a mighty effort he reared himself to his
feet, straightening his slanted shoulders, erecting
his lolled head. His fingers fumbled at button
and buttonhole, fastening his coat at the
throat. He swung one arm imperiously, warding
off imaginary hands.</p>

<p>“‘The trumpets! The trumpets! Hark!
They come nearer and nearer! They sound
for the victory of France&mdash;for a heroic army.
I will go! Doctor or no doctor, I pay my
homage this day to our glorious army. Stand
back, <i>ma chérie</i>!’”</p>

<p>Offutt, fifty feet away, caught himself straining
his ears to hear those trumpets too. A rat
ran across his foot and Offutt never knew it.</p>

<p>“‘They come! They come!<!-- exclamation mark omitted in original -->’” chuckled Bateman.</p>

<p><a name="p238" id="p238"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>238<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span>He dragged himself up stage, mounted the
two stairs to the balcony, and stood in the window,
at attention, to salute the tri-coloured flag.
Nor did he forget to keep his face half turned
to the body of the house.</p>

<p>He smiled; and the two unseen spies, staring
at that profiled head, saw the joy that was in
the smile. Then, in the same moment, the expression
changed. Dumb astonishment came
first&mdash;an unbelieving astonishment; then blank
stupefaction; then the shock of horrified understanding;
then unutterable rage.</p>

<p>Offutt recalled the tale from which the playlet
had been evolved, and Verba, for his part,
recalled the playlet; but, had neither known
what they knew, the both of them, guided and
informed only by the quality of Bateman’s acting,
still could have anticipated the climax now
impending; and, lacking all prior acquaintance
with the plot of it, yet would have read that the
cripple, expecting to cheer his beloved French,
saw advancing beneath the Arc de Triomphe
the heads of the conquering Germans, and
heard, above the calling bugles, not the Marseillaise,
but the strains of a Teuton marching
song. His back literally bristled with his hate.
He spun about full face, a mortally stricken
man. His clenched fists rose above his head
in a command.</p>

<p>“‘To arms! To arms!’” he screamed impotently,
with the rattle already in his throat.
“‘The Prussians! The <span class="nw">Prus&mdash;&mdash;’</span>”</p>

<p><a name="p239" id="p239"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>239<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span>He choked, tottered down the steps, reeled
forward and fell headlong out into the room,
rolling in the death spasm behind the draped
table; and as, ten seconds later, the curtain
began to unroll from above and lengthen down,
Offutt found himself saying over and over again,
mechanically:</p>

<p>“Why, he’s gone, isn’t he?”</p>

<p>“He kept the table between him and the
house and crawled out behind it&mdash;trust him
not to spoil his picture!” explained Verba.
“And trust him to know the tricks of his trade.”
He tugged at Offutt’s elbow. “Come on, boy;
I’ve seen enough and so have you, I guess.
Let’s go sign him.”</p>

<p>He fumbled at the wall.</p>

<p>“Side passageway back to the stage ought to be
round here somewhere. Here it is&mdash;that’s lucky!”</p>

<p>Guiding himself by the touching of his outstretched
hands upon the walls of the opening,
Verba felt his way behind the box, with Offutt
stumbling along in his rear. So progressing,
they came to an iron-sheathed door. Verba
lifted its latch and they were in a place of
rancid smells and cluttering stage duffel.
Roaches fled in front of them. On their left a
small wooden door stood partly ajar, and
through the cranny they looked, as they passed,
into a dressing room, where a pallet of old
hangings covered half the floor space, and all
manner of dingy stock costumings and stage
trappings hung upon hooks.</p>

<p><a name="p240" id="p240"></a><span class="pagenum"><span

 /></span></span>“Here’s where he must sleep,” said Verba.
“What a place for a white man to be living in!”</p>

<p>He felt for his handkerchief to wipe his soiled
hands, and then together they saw Bateman advancing
toward them from out of the extreme
rear of the stage. Over his shoulders was
thrown a robe of heavy ragged sacking and
upon his face he had hung a long, false beard
of white hair. He glared at them angrily. And
Offutt, in instantaneous appraisal, interpreted
most surely the look out of those staring big
grey eyes.</p>

<p>Verba extended his hand and opened his
mouth to speak; but Bateman was already
speaking.</p>

<p>“What business have you here?” he demanded.
“Strangers are not permitted here during
performances. How came the stage doorkeeper
to admit you? He has been here too long, that
doorkeeper, and he grows careless. I shall have
him discharged.”</p>

<p>“But, Mr. Bateman,” began Verba, half puzzled,
half insistent, “I’m in the business myself.
I want <span class="nw">to&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>“Stand aside!” ordered the old man almost
violently. “You cannot have been long in the
business, young sir, else you would be more
mannerly than to interrupt an artist when his
public calls for him. Out of my way, please!”</p>

<p>He strutted by them in stilted vanity and
gripped the lifting ropes of the old curtain where
they swung in the near angle of the wings, and
<a name="p241" id="p241"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>241<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>pulled downward on them with an unexpected
display of muscular force. The curtain rose;
and as Blinky, still at his place, uplifted a little
yell of approbation the old man, bending his
shoulders, passed out into the centre of the
French drawing-room set and, extending a quivering
hand, uttered sonorously the command:</p>

<p>“‘Blow, winds, and crack your cheeks! rage!
blow!’”</p>

<p>“The mad scene from King Lear,” said
Offutt.</p>

<p>“Sure&mdash;Shakspere!” agreed Verba. “Old
Scudder was a bug on that Bard stuff. So was
Bateman. He used to know it from cover to
cover&mdash;Othello, Hamlet, Lear&mdash;the whole string. &hellip;
Anyhow, Offutt, I’ve found the only man
to do the grandfather’s part in that show of
yours, haven’t I?”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry to say it, Verba, but you’re
wrong,” stated Offutt.</p>

<p>“How do you mean&mdash;I’m wrong?” demanded
Verba irritably. Out of the corner of his mouth
he aimed the protest at his companion; but his
eyes, through the gap of the first entrance,
were fixed on Bateman as he strode back and
forth, and his ears drank in the splendid full-lunged
volume and thrill of Bateman’s voice as
the player spoke snatches from the play. “He’s
not too old&mdash;if that’s what you mean; he’s just
about old enough. And he’s all there, even if
he is old. Didn’t you see the strength he had
when he hoisted up that heavy curtain?”</p>

<p><a name="p242" id="p242"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>242<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span>“I think I know where that strength came
from,” said Offutt. “Just a minute, Verba&mdash;did
you ever hear of the Great Auk?”</p>

<p>“He was in vaudeville, wasn’t he?” asked
Verba, still staring at Bateman. “A trick juggler
or something?”</p>

<p>Offutt forgot to smile.</p>

<p>“The Great Auk was a bird,” he said.</p>

<p>“Oh, I see; and I’ve been calling Bateman
Old Bird,” said Verba. “I get you.”</p>

<p>“No, you don’t get me,” went on Offutt.
“The Great Auk was a rare creature. It got
rarer and rarer until they thought it had vanished.
They sent an expedition to the Arctic
Circle, or wherever it was the thing bred, to
get one specimen for the museums; but they
came back without it. And now the Great
Auk is an extinct species.”</p>

<p>“What the devil are you driving at?” snapped
Verba, swinging on him.</p>

<p>“Listen yonder!” bade the dramatist. “That
old man out yonder is telling you, himself, in
better words than I could tell you.”</p>

<p>He pointed a finger through the wings. Craning
their necks, they heard the deep voice speak
the lines:</p>

<p id="play">“‘Pray, do not mock me:<br
 />I am a very foolish fond old man,<br
 />Fourscore and upward, not an hour more nor less;<br
 />And, to deal plainly,<br
 />I fear I am not in my perfect mind.’”</p>

<p><a name="p243" id="p243"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>243<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span>Verba hearkened and he understood. After
a little he nodded in gloomy affirmation of the
younger man’s belief.</p>

<p>“I guess you’re right, Offutt,” he said disappointedly.
“I guess I’d have seen it, too, only
I was so sort of carried away. Real acting
does me that way&mdash;when I see it, which ain’t
often.”</p>

<p>He paused a minute in uncertainty. Then
resolution came to him.</p>

<p>“Well,” he said, “come on; there’s no use of
our hanging round here any longer. I’ll give
Blinky his quarter&mdash;he certainly earned it ten
times over&mdash;and then we’ll go back uptown, and
I’ll telephone Grainger he can have his seventy-five
more a week.”</p>

<p>“But what are we going to do about&mdash;him?”
Offutt indicated who he meant with a wave of
his arm toward the stage.</p>

<p>It was Verba’s turn. Verba knew the stage
and its people and its ways as Offutt would
never know them. He had been an actor, Verba
had, before he turned managing director for
Cohalan &amp; Hymen.</p>

<p>“What are we going to do about him?” he
repeated; and then, as though surprised that
the other should be asking the question: “Why,
nothing! Offutt, every haunted house is entitled
to its ghost. This is a haunted house if
ever there was one; and there’s its ghost, standing
out there. You mentioned an extinct species,
didn’t you? Well, you were dead right,
<a name="p244" id="p244"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>244<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>son. So take your good-by look now, before
we go, at the last of a great breed. There’ll be
no more like him, I’m thinking.”</p>

<p>“But we can’t leave him here like this!” said
Offutt. “His mind is gone&mdash;you admit it yourself.
They’ve got hospitals and asylums in
this state&mdash;and homes too. It would be a mercy
to take him with us.”</p>

<p>“Mercy? It would be the dam’dest cruelty
on earth!” snapped Verba. “How long do you
suppose he’d live in an asylum if we tore him
up by the roots and dragged him away from
this place? A week? I tell you, a week would
be a blamed long time. No, sir; we leave him
right here. And we’ll keep our mouths shut
about this too. Come on!”</p>

<p>He tiptoed to the iron door and opened it softly.
Then, with his hand on the latch, he halted.</p>

<p>Bateman was just finishing. He spoke the
mad king’s mad tag-line and got himself off
the stage. He unreeled the stay rope from its
chock. The curtain rumbled down. Through
it the insistent smacking of Blinky’s skinny paws
could be heard.</p>

<p>Smiling proudly the old man listened to the
sound. He forgot their presence behind him.
He stood waiting. Blinky kept on applauding&mdash;Blinky
was wise in his part too. Then, still
smiling, Bateman stripped off his beard, and,
putting forth a bony white hand, he plucked
aside the flapping curtain and stepped forth
once more.</p>

<p><a name="p245" id="p245"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>245<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span>Scrouging up behind him and holding the
curtain agape, they saw him bow low to the
pit where Blinky was, and to the empty boxes,
and to the yawning emptiness of each balcony;
and they knew that to him this was not a
mangy cavern of dead memories and dead traditions
and dead days, peopled only by gnawing
rats and crawling vermin and one lone little
one-eyed street boy, but a place of living grandeurs
and living triumphs. And when he spoke,
then they knew he spoke, not to one but to a
worshipping, clamorous host.</p>

<p>“Ladies and gentlemen,” he began, with a
bearing of splendid conceit, “I thank you for
the ovation you have given me. To an artist&mdash;to
an artist who values his art&mdash;such moments
as this are most <span class="nw">precious&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>“Come on, Offutt!” whispered Verba huskily.
“Leave him taking his call.”</p>

 </span>CHAPTER VII<br
 /><span class="so">FIRST CORINTHIANS<br
 />CHAP. XIII., v. 4</span></h2>


<p class="newchap"><span class="dropcap ml6">Since</span> this must deal in great part with
the Finkelstein family and what charity
did for them, I began the task by seeking
in the pages of an invaluable book
called Ten Thousand Familiar Quotations for
a line that suitably might serve as the text to
my chapter. Delving there I came upon abundant
material, all of it more or less appropriate
to our present purpose. There were revealed
at least a half a dozen extracts from the works
of writers of an established standing that might
be made to apply. For instance, Wordsworth,
an English poet of the Early Victorian Era,
that period which gave so much of rhythmic
thought to Britain and so much of antirhythmic
furniture to us, is credited with having said:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div><i>The charities that soothe and heal and bless</i></div>
<div><i>Are scattered at the feet of man like flowers.</i></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><a name="p247" id="p247"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>247<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span>Now that passage, at first blush, appeared exactly
to fit the Finkelsteins. Most certainly
charities were scattered at their feet and likewise
showered on their heads.</p>

<p>However, before making a definite choice, I
went deeper into this handy volume. As a result,
I exhumed an expression attributed to
Pope&mdash;not one of the Roman Popes, but Pope,
Alex. (b. 1688; d. 1744)&mdash;to the effect that</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div><i>In faith and hope the world will disagree,</i></div>
<div><i>But all mankind’s concern is charity.</i></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>That statement likewise proved in a measure
applicable. To the Finkelsteins it must have
seemed that all mankind’s concern was charity,
devised for their especial benefit.</p>

<p>Now Hood takes an opposite view. In that
choppy style of versification so characteristic
of this writer, Hood is discovered saying:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div><i>Alas for the rarity</i></div>
<div><i>Of Christian charity</i></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="ns">  </span><i>Under the sun!</i></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Speaking with particular reference to the case
in hand I must respectfully but nevertheless
firmly take issue with the late Hood. Assuredly
the components of this particular household
group had no cause to cavil concerning the
rarity of Christian charity. Christian charity
went miles out of its way to lavish rich treasures
from a full heart upon them. Under the
sun, too, under the rays of an ardent and a
<a name="p248" id="p248"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>248<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>scorching sun, was some of it bestowed. But of
that phase, more&mdash;as the fancy writers say&mdash;anon.</p>

<p>The Scriptures were found to abound in reference
to this most precious of the human virtues.
What does Peter say? Peter&mdash;First Epistle,
fourth chapter and eighth verse&mdash;says: “Charity
shall cover the multitude of sins.” Here,
too, a point might be stretched without giving
offence to any interested party. I cannot deny
there were a multitude of Finkelsteins. That,
there is no gainsaying.</p>

<p>Elsewhere in the Good Book it is set forth:
“Though I speak with the tongues of men and
of angels, and have not charity, I am become as
sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal; &hellip; and”&mdash;furthermore&mdash;“though
I have all faith, so
that I could remove mountains, and have not
charity, I am nothing.”</p>

<p>One of the most significant recollections of at
least two members of the Finkelstein family in
their experiences with the manifestations of
charity was associated with mountains. And
was not the occasion of the outing of the <i>Evening
Dispatch’s</i> Fresh Air Fund made glad by the
presence and the activities of Prof. Washington
Carter’s All-Coloured Silver Cornet Band?
If ever you heard this organisation you would
know that, when it came to sounding brass and
cymbals which tinkled when not engaged in
clashing, no band had anything whatsoever on
Prof. Washington Carter’s.</p>

<p><a name="p249" id="p249"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>249<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span>But it was hard by, in the Testaments, that I
happened on the one verse which seemed best to
sum up the situation in its more general aspects;
and notably the first three words of the said
verse. The text has been chosen, therefore,
after much consideration of the subject and its
merits.</p>

<p>To proceed: In Pike Street, approximately
midway of a block that enjoys the dubious distinction
of being a part of the most congested
district of the globe, up four flights of stairs and
thence back to the extreme rear, the Finkelstein
family, at the time of its discovery, resided.
There were many of them and their lot was very
lowly. To begin at the top, there was Papa
Finkelstein, a man bearded and small, shrinking,
unobtrusive and diffident; fashioned with
sloping shoulders and an indented chest as
though in his extreme youth, when his bones
were supple and yielding, a partly successful
effort had been made to crowd him, head first,
into a narrow-mouthed jar. His back was bent,
for he was of the race that for more than nineteen
centuries has borne, palfrey-like, upon its patient
spines the persecutions of the world.</p>

<p>Next in order came Mamma Finkelstein,
hiding her dark head beneath a wig of slick
brown horsehair in accordance with the same
ritual which ordained that her husband should
touch not the corners of his beard. To attend
to the business of multiplying and replenishing
the earth with Finkelsteins was her chief
<a name="p250" id="p250"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>250<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>mission in life. From the family stepladder of
these two no rungs were missing. Indeed,
about a third of the way down there was a
double rung&mdash;to wit, twins. The married life
of the pair extended over a period of less than
eleven years and already there were eight little
Finkelsteins, ranging from little to littler to
littlest.</p>

<p>Papa Finkelstein was by profession an old-clo’ man.
It was his custom to go into the favoured
sections where people laid aside their weathered
habiliments instead of continuing to wear them,
and there watching on street corners to waylay
pedestrians of an ample and prosperous aspect,
and to inquire of them in his timid and twisted
English, whether they had any old clothes to
sell. A prospective seller being by this method
interested, Papa Finkelstein would accompany
the other to his apartment&mdash;follow him, rather&mdash;and
when discarded garments had been
fetched forth from closets and piled in a heap
upon the floor he would gaze deprecatingly at
the accumulation and then, with the air of
one who courts ruin by his excessive generosity,
tender one dollar and thirty-five cents for the
entire lot.</p>

<p>So far so good, this course being in perfect
accord with the ethics of the old-clo’ business.
But if, as most generally, the owner of the raiment
indignantly declined the first offer Papa
Finkelstein was at a loss to proceed with the
negotiations. The chaffering; the bargaining;
<a name="p251" id="p251"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>251<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>the raising of the amount in ten-cent advances,
each advance accompanied by agonised outcry;
the pretended departure; the reluctant return
from the door; the protest; the entreaty; the
final gesture, betokening abject and complete
surrender, with which the buyer came up to two
dollars and fifteen cents&mdash;all this, so agreeable to
the nature of the born old-clo’ man, was quite
beyond him. Oftener than not, the trading
ended in no trade.</p>

<p>Or if a bargain was arrived at, if he bore away
his bundled purchases to the old-clothes mart on
Bayard Street, just off the Bowery, where daily
the specialist in sick hats, let us say, swaps
decrepit odd trousers and enfeebled dress waistcoats
for wares more suitable to his needs, still
he tempted bankruptcy. Sharper wits than
his, by sheer weight of dominance, bore him
down and trafficked him, as the saying goes,
out of his eyeteeth. He could have taken over
a tannery and run it into a shoestring in no
time at all. Many a day was there when he returned
home at eventide with nothing to show
for his day’s industry except lamentable memories
and two tired flat feet.</p>

<p>Lacking the commercial instinct, he was a
failure in trade; lacking, too, the artistic,
neither would he have made headway with his
coreligionists as a professional <i>Schnorrer</i>. By
persistent and devoutful attendance upon synagogue
services, by the constant exhibition of
his poverty in public places, he might have
<a name="p252" id="p252"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>252<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>enlisted the sympathies of the benevolent among
his fellow worshippers. But he was a dilettante
in the practice of piety, even as in the practice
of the old-clo’ business. Except as the head of
a family, he was what this world is pleased to
call a failure.</p>

<p>From all this I would not have you jump at
the conclusion that Papa and Mamma Finkelstein
and their steadily accruing progeny constituted
an unhappy group. Mere precarious
existence and the companionship of one another
spelled for them contentment. The swarming
East Side satisfied them as an abiding place.
To the adults it was a better home by far than
the drear, dreadful land of pogroms and Black
Hundreds from which they had fled; to the
younger ones it was the only home they had ever
known. They were used to its tormented sky
lines, faced in on either side by tall tenements
and blocked across by the structures of elevated
roads and the stone loops of viaducts; they
were used to its secondhand sunshine that filtered
down to them through girders and spans.
To them the high arch of the Bridge approach
was an acceptable substitute for the rainbow;
their idea of the profusion of Nature was a tiny
square, containing many green benches, a circular
band stand, and here and there a spindling
tree.</p>

<p>Having nothing they craved for nothing.
When there was food they ate thereof; <i>kosher</i>
food preferably, though the food of the <i>Goyim</i>
<a name="p253" id="p253"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>253<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>was not despised. When there was none they
went without, feeding on the thought of past
feasts and the hope of future ones. Being without
knowledge of the commoner rule of hygiene,
their days were neither enhanced by its advantages
nor disturbed by its observances.</p>

<p>With the coming of the winter Mamma Finkelstein
sewed up her offspring, all and sundry, in
their heavy undergarments. Only one consideration
ever interposed to prevent her from so
doing&mdash;the occasional absence of any heavy
undergarments in which to sew them up. To
the pores, which always ye have with ye, she
gave no heed. An interrupted duct more or less
meant nothing to her, she being serenely unaware
of the existence of such things as ducts,
anyhow. In the springtime she cut the stitches
and removed the garments, or such portions of
them as had not been taken up by natural
process of absorption, finding her young, as
now newly revealed, to be pinkish, though soiled
as to their skins, and in every regard hale,
hearty and wholesome.</p>

<p>Thus abided the Finkelsteins in their dire
and happy extremity at the time of their discovery.
The manner of their being discovered
came about as follows:</p>

<p>Christmastide impended. The spirit of it
was every where reflected: in the price tags; in
the swollen ankles and aching insteps of shop
girls on their feet behind counters twelve to
fifteen hours a day; in the harassed
<a name="p254" id="p254"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>254<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>countenances and despairing eyes of shoppers; in the
heaving sides and drooping heads of wearied
delivery-wagon teams; in the thoughts of the
children of the rich, dissatisfied because there
was nothing Santa Claus could bring them they
didn’t already have; in the thoughts of the children
of the poor, happy as they pressed their
cold little noses against the plate-glass fronts of
toy shop windows and made discriminating
selection of the treasures which they would like
for Santa to bring them, but knowing at the
same time he couldn’t because of his previous
engagements among the best families.</p>

<p>This all-pervading spirit penetrated even into
the newspaper offices, borne thither upon the
flapping wings of the full-page display advertisements
of our leading retail establishments. One
of the papers&mdash;the <i>Morning Advocate</i>&mdash;compiled
a symposium of paragraphed miseries under the
title of the One Hundred Most Deserving Cases
of Charity, and on the Monday before Christmas
printed it with a view to enlisting the aid
of the kindly disposed. The list was culled
largely from the files of various philanthropic
organisations. But it so befell that a reporter,
who had been detailed on these assignments,
was passing through Pike Street on his way back
to the office from one of the settlement houses
when he encountered Papa Finkelstein, homeward
bound after a particularly disappointing
business day uptown.</p>

<p>The reporter was impressed much by the
<a name="p255" id="p255"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>255<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>despondent droop of the little man’s sloping
shoulders and by the melancholy smoulder in his
big, dark eyes; but more was he impressed by
the costume of Papa Finkelstein. It was a part
of Papa Finkelstein’s burden of affliction that
he customarily wore winter clothes in the summertime
and summer clothes in the wintertime.
On this gusty, raw December day he wore somebody’s
summer suit&mdash;a much larger somebody
evidently&mdash;and a suit that in its youth had
been of light-coloured, lightweight flannel. It
was still lightweight.</p>

<p>Infolded within its voluminous breadths the
present wearer shivered visibly and drew his
chilled hands farther up into its flapping sleeve
ends until he resembled the doubly mutilated
victim of a planing-mill mishap. If his expression
was woebegone, his shoe soles were
more&mdash;they practically were all-begone. A
battered derby hat&mdash;size about seven and five-eighths&mdash;threatened
total extinguishment of his
face, being prevented from doing so only by the
circumstance of its brim resting and pressing
upon the upper flanges of the owner’s ears.
They were ears providentially designed for such
employment. Broad, wide and droopy, they
stood out from the sides of Papa Finkelstein’s
head like the horns of the caribou.</p>

<p>This reporter was a good reporter. He knew
a human-interest story when he met it walking
in the road. He turned about and tagged Papa
Finkelstein to his domicile and there, after
<a name="p256" id="p256"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>256<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>briefly inspecting the Finkelstein household
in all its wealth of picturesque destitution, he
secured the names and the address from the
head of it, who perhaps gave the desired information
all the more readily because he had not
the slightest idea of what use this inquiring
stranger wished to make of it.</p>

<p>Half an hour later the reporter was saying to
the irritable functionary in charge of the <i>Advocate’s</i>
news desk:</p>

<p>“Oh, so-so; just fair to middling, most of
them; about the usual run of shad. But, say,
I’ve got one bird of a case. I dug it up myself&mdash;it’s
not down on any of the records I got
from the charity people. When it comes to
being plumb down and out none of them has
anything on the meek and lowly Finkelsteins.”</p>

<p>“Good!” said the news editor. “You might
lead with it if you want to. No, I guess you’d
better run ’em alphabetically&mdash;it won’t do to be
playing favourites.”</p>

<p>Mark now, how a little flame may kindle a
large blaze: The afternoon half sister of the
<i>Morning Advocate</i> was the <i>Evening Dispatch</i>.
Between the two papers, owned as they were
by the same gentleman and issued from the
same printshop, a bitter rivalry prevailed; it
generally does in such instances.</p>

<p>On Tuesday morning the city editor of the
<i>Evening Dispatch</i> ran an agile and practiced eye
through the story the <i>Advocate</i> had printed.
With his shears he chopped out the first column
<a name="p257" id="p257"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>257<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>of it. With his pencil he ringed one paragraph
in the scissored section and then he lifted his
voice and called to him a young woman professionally
known as Betty Gwin, who sat in the
city room at a desk somewhat withdrawn from
copy readers, rewriters and leg men. This distinction
of comparative aloofness was hers by
right, she being a special-feature writer, under
yearly contract, and, therefore, belonging to
the aristocracy of the craft.</p>

<p>After the custom of her sex Miss Betty Gwin&mdash;whose
real name, I may state, in confidence,
was Ferguson&mdash;first put a hand up to be sure
that her hair was quite right and then put it
behind her to be sure her belt made proper connection
with her skirt at the back; and then
she answered her superior’s call. Answering it,
all about her betokened confidence and competence.
And why shouldn’t it? As a pen-smith
this young person acknowledged no superiors
anywhere. Her troupe of trained performing
adjectives was admitted to be the
smartest in town. Moreover, she was artistically
ambidextrous. Having written a story
she would illustrate it with her own hand. Her
drawings were replete with lithesome curves; so,
too, was her literary style. None but a Betty
Gwin could write what she wrote; none but a
Betty Gwin properly illustrate it afterward.</p>

<p>“Fergy,” said the city editor, “here’s a beaut
for you&mdash;right in your line. Full of that heart-throb
junk nine ways from the jack. Those
<a name="p258" id="p258"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>258<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>idiots upstairs gave it ten lines when it was
worth six sticks all by itself&mdash;buried it when
they should have played it up. You run down
to this number and get a good, gummy, pathetic
yarn. We’ll play it up for to-morrow, with a
strong picture layout and a three-col. head.
Might call it: ‘What Christmas Means
for the Whatyoumaycall’em Family and
What Christmas Might Mean for Them!’
Get me?”</p>

<p>He passed over the clipping. In a glance his
star comprehended the pencilled passage.</p>

<p>“Judging from the name and the neighbourhood
Christmas wouldn’t excite this family
much, anyhow,” she said.</p>

<p>“What do you care?” said her chief crisply.
“There’s a story there&mdash;go get it!”</p>

<p>Doubtlessly the Christmas spirit got into
Betty Gwin’s typewriter keys. Certainly it
got into her inkpot and deposited the real essence
of the real sob stuff there. The story she
wrote trickled pathos from every balanced paragraph;
there was pity in the periods and sentiment
in the semicolons. As for the exclamation-points,
they simply were elongated tear
drops. It was one of the best stories Betty
Gwin ever wrote. She said so herself&mdash;openly.
But the picture that went with the story was
absolutely diademic; it crowned figures of
speech with tiaras of the graphic art. It
showed Mamma Finkelstein seated on an
upended box, which once had contained pickled
<a name="p259" id="p259"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>259<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>herrings, surrounded by the eight little Finkelsteins.
The children looked like ragged
cherubs.</p>

<p>To accomplish this result it had been necessary
for Miss Gwin to depart somewhat from a
faithful delineation of the originals. But of
what value is the creative ability unless it be
used to create? I ask you that and pause for a
reply. Not that the junior Finkelsteins were
homely; without an exception they were handsome
and well-formed. A millionaire might
have been proud to own them.</p>

<p>But the trouble was, the Old Masters, who
first painted cherubim, were mainly Italians, and
for a variety of reasons chose their models from
a race other than that to which the Finkelsteins
appertained. To make her portraits conform
with the popular conceptions of cherubs Miss
Gwin saw fit to&mdash;shall we say?&mdash;conventionalise
certain features. Indeed, when it came to
reproducing for publication the physical aspect
of Master Solly Finkelstein she did more than
conventionalise&mdash;she idealised. Otherwise subscribers,
giving the picture a cursory inspection,
might have been led to believe that this cherub’s
wings had sprouted mighty high up on him.
For Solly, eldest man child of the Finkelstein
brood, had inherited the paternal ear&mdash;not all
of it, as we know, but an ample and conspicuous
sufficiency. Yet, with his ears trimmed,
he, on his own merits, had enough of sombre
child beauty for any seven-year-older
<a name="p260" id="p260"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>260<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>anywhere. So Betty Gwin trimmed them&mdash;with
her drawing pencil.</p>

<p>The bright light of publicity having been
directed upon this cheerfully forlorn family, results
followed. Of the publicity its beneficiaries
knew nothing. Such papers as Papa Finkelstein
read were Yiddish papers; he was no
bookworm at that. Of the results, though, they
were all speedily made aware.</p>

<p>Miss Gwin embodied the original and pioneer
one of the forces speedily set marching to the
relief of the Finkelsteins. Persons of a philanthropic
leaning, reading what she had written
and beholding what she had drawn, were
straightway moved to forward, in care of that
young author and the publication which she
served, various small sums of money to be conveyed
to this practically fireless, substantially
foodless and semigarmentless household. Miss
Gwin thought, at first, of founding a regular
subscription list under the title of Betty Gwin’s
Succour Fund; but, on second thought, disliked
the sound of the phrase when spoken,
although it looked well enough written out.</p>

<p>Instead, she elected to carry in person to their
proper destination the cash contributions already
in hand, and along with them a somewhat more
cumbersome offering consisting of a one-piece
costume sent by a young lady in the theatrical
profession&mdash;the chorus profession, to be circumstantial
about it&mdash;who had accompanied the
donation with a note on scented violet note
<a name="p261" id="p261"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>261<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>paper, with a crest, stating that she wished the
devoted mother of those “poor birdlings”&mdash;a
direct quotation, this, from Miss Gwin’s story&mdash;to
have the frock, and to keep it and wear it for
her very own. With the Compliments of Miss
Trixie Adair, of the Gay Gamboliers Musical
Comedy Company.</p>

<p>Thus laden, Miss Gwin descended upon Pike
Street and ascended upon the Finkelsteins,
bringing with her, in addition to the other things
mentioned, an air of buoyancy and good cheer.
As on the occasion of her former call, two days
earlier, the medium of intercourse between the
visitor and the heads of the household was
Miriam, aged nine, the topmost round of the
family stepladder, ably reenforced by her
brother Solly, who was mentioned just a bit
ago with particular reference to his ears. In
truth I should put it the other way round; for,
to be exact, it was Solly who sustained the main
burden of translation, his sister being a shy
little thing and he in temperament emphatically
the opposite.</p>

<p>Besides, his opportunities for acquiring facility
and a repertoire in tongues had been more
extensive than hers. While Miriam frequented
the hallways of the tenement, or, at best, the
sidewalk in front of it, concerned with the
minding of the twins&mdash;Israel and Isadore, but
both called, for convenience, Izzy&mdash;it was his
practice to range far and wide, risking death
beneath trolley cars, capture by the law, and
<a name="p262" id="p262"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>262<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>murder at the hands of roused custodians of
jobbing houses and buildings in course of construction,
about which he lurked on the lookout
for empty packing cases and bits of planking,
and the like&mdash;such stuff as might be dragged
home and there converted into household furnishings
or stove fuel, depending upon whether
at the moment the establishment stood more
desperately in need of something to sit on than
of something to burn.</p>

<p>Even now, at the tender age of seven, going
on eight, Solly betrayed the stirrings of a restless
ambition such as his sire had never known.
It was an open question whether he would grow
up to be a gunman or a revered captain of
finance. A tug of fate might set his eager footsteps
toward either goal. Already he had a
flowing command of the sort of English spoken
by startled and indignant motormen, pestered
policemen and watchmen, tempted by provocation<!-- original reads 'provacation' -->
entirely beyond their powers of self-control.
So Solly served as chief interpreter
while Miss Gwin informally tendered the presents
that had been intrusted to her charge for
transmission.</p>

<p>In the same spirit Papa and Mamma Finkelstein,
who continued to entertain the vaguest
of theories regarding the sources of and the reasons
for these benefactions, accepted them
gratefully, with no desire to look a gift horse
in the mouth. Gift horses were strange livestock
in their experience, anyhow.</p>

<p><a name="p263" id="p263"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>263<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span>The money&mdash;eight dollars and ninety-five
cents, all told&mdash;went for fuel and food; but
mainly for food. With the Finkelsteins, life
was a feast or else it was a famine; in their
scheme of domestic economics they sought no
middle ground. As for the gown bestowed by
Miss Trixie Adair, of the Gay Gamboliers,
Mamma Finkelstein started wearing it right
away, merely adapting it to existing conditions&mdash;conditions
that were, with her, not only existent
but, I may say, chronic. It was&mdash;or had
been&mdash;a pale-blue evening gown of a satinlike
material, with no neck and no sleeves to the
upper part, but with a gracefully long train to
the skirt part, and made to hook up the back.</p>

<p>Because of the frequency of the demands put
upon the maternal resources by the newest and
smallest Finkelstein, it was deemed expedient
and, in fact, essential to turn the gown round
backward, so as to have the bodice fastenings
directly in front of Mamma Finkelstein instead
of directly behind her. This necessitated drawing
the train up from beneath the occupant’s
feet and draping it, sash-fashion, about her
waist. Mamma Finkelstein wore it so. She
was wearing it so that afternoon when Mrs. F.
Fodderwood Bass arrived, direct from upper
Fifth Avenue, and also the next morning when
Miss Godiva Sleybells came, representing, semi-officially
and most competently, the Cherry Hill
Neighbourhood House.</p>

<p>Since of these two Mrs. F. Fodderwood Bass
<a name="p264" id="p264"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>264<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>was first, firstly then we may consider her. I
will begin by stating that she was a lady of
augmented wealth and indubitable preeminence,
being of that elect group who have
ceased merely to smell society from afar off
and now taste of its exclusive delights close up.
For her it had been a hard climb, laboriously
uphill all the way, boulder-strewn and beset
by hazards, pitfalls and obstacles. But she had
arrived finally upon those snow-capped peaks
where the temperature is ever below freezing
and life may only be maintained artificially.</p>

<p>Inasmuch as she had not been born to
breathe the atmosphere of this rarefied altitude,
but had achieved her right to breathe it by her
own efforts, Mrs. F. Fodderwood Bass felt it
incumbent on her to maintain her position
away up there on Mount Saint Elias by such
manifold and varied activities as were most
aptly designed to make for publicity, which
meant prominence, which meant success. For
the moment she was principally concerned with
living up to the rôle of good angel to the
worthily indigent. Those who loved her and
in return wished to be loved by her called her
the Lady Bountiful of the Slums.</p>

<p>She conferred the sweet boon of charity with
the aid of a press agent, a subscription to a
clipping bureau, a special secretary&mdash;not her
regular secretary, but a special one&mdash;and a new
photograph&mdash;copyright by De Valle, Fifth
Avenue, all infringements prohibited&mdash;appearing
<a name="p265" id="p265"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>265<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>about once in so often in the Sunday Magazine
Sections.</p>

<p>It was no strain upon the eyes to gaze upon
Mrs. F. Fodderwood Bass; nor yet upon her
photograph. Nor did she consciously and willfully
deny any properly respectful person the
opportunity. A distinguished portrait painter
once had said, shortly after completing a commission
which brought him large pecuniary
returns from Mr. F. Fodderwood Bass, that
Mrs. F. Fodderwood Bass possessed the most
beautiful profile on the entire North American
continent. When in company the recipient of
this tribute kept her side face turned to the
majority present&mdash;the greatest possible good
to the greatest possible number, you see. She
had one secret regret: one could not walk sideways&mdash;or,
at least, one could not for any considerable
distance.</p>

<p>I would not go so far as to say that Mrs. F.
Fodderwood Bass actually read the prose poem
emanating from Miss Betty Gwin’s sympathetic
typewriter; but I will go so far as to say
that promptly the article of that gifted young
word chandler was brought to her attention.
No time was to be lost; in fact, no time was
lost. Very shortly thereafter Mrs. F. Fodderwood
Bass, attired in housings appropriately
plain, to accord with her errand&mdash;housings
which had cost less than five hundred dollars,
exclusive of import duties&mdash;and suitably riding
in a simple French limousine of but forty-eight
<a name="p266" id="p266"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>266<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>horse power, was conveyed southward and
eastward from her home to Pike Street. Her
arrival there created a measure of popular
tumult only to be equalled by a bank run or a
fire alarm. A self-appointed escort at least
seventy-five strong piloted her up four flights
to the Finkelstein flat.</p>

<p>Papa Finkelstein was out temporarily, and
Mamma Finkelstein was stunned into a state
approximating dumb stupor by the grandeur
of the visitation that appeared before her, heralded
though its coming had been by many
small, excited couriers dashing up the stairs in
advance. Though Mamma Finkelstein was of
humble station, Mrs. F. Fodderwood Bass did
not deny her a treat. Throughout her stay,
which was short, she remained standing in the
doorway, with her profile presented to the
dazzled stare of her hostess.</p>

<p>Her purpose being explained through volunteer
interpreters, and largess having been
bestowed generally, she masterfully bore away
Miriam, Solly and the two small duplicate Izzys,
Mamma Finkelstein making no sign either of
demur to or acquiescence in the plan, to a
Christmas-tree entertainment given under her
direct patronage in a rented hall some distance
north of Cooper Union.</p>

<p>At eight <span class="allsc">P.&nbsp;M.</span>, long before their mother had
in any visible respect rallied from her coma of
dumb bewilderment, these four, a torpid and
satiated quartet, were safely returned to the
<a name="p267" id="p267"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>267<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>home nest, gorged on goodies, and laden with
small gifts for themselves and for their yet
more juvenile sisters and brothers. Throughout
the remainder of the evening, though, little
Miriam persisted in regarding her father with a
certain silent and distressful reproach in her
big black eyes. Made uneasy by his daughter’s
bearing he questioned her; and she divulged
something she had heard.</p>

<p>It seemed that in explaining the intent of the
festival of Christmas, Mrs. F. Fodderwood
Bass, though actuated by the best intentions
imaginable, had nevertheless revealed certain
phases of Sacred History which, when the first
shock of disclosure was over, left sensitive little
Miriam in a state of mind where she stood
ready to fix direct responsibility upon her own
parent. Papa Finkelstein may have been lax
in the precept and practice of his theological
beliefs, but assuredly his convictions were both
sound and orthodox. Immediately he developed
an entirely unwarranted but none the
less sincere distrust for the motives of Mrs. F.
Fodderwood Bass.</p>

<p>Truly, he wronged her there. There was
nothing that was ulterior, but much that was
superior in the lady’s attitude toward the lower
forms of animal life which she observed flourishing
below her. By lower forms of animal
life I, as the historian of this episode, would include
everything and everybody outside of her
set. These lesser manifestations of an inscrutable
<a name="p268" id="p268"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>268<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>scheme of creation she regarded benignantly,
tolerantly and at times&mdash;wonderingly.
To her they seemed so&mdash;well, so different&mdash;if
you get my meaning and hers. One wondered
sometimes, really one did, if they could be so
susceptible to emotion and sensation as those
who had been called to service in a higher
sphere of activity? The answer might be yes
and then again it might be no. It all depended
upon one’s point of view. Indeed when one
came to ponder these matters, so much always
did depend upon one’s point of view, did it not?
Meanwhile pending the ultimate solution of
these perplexing sociological problems, she
would minister Samaritanlike to the wants of
the needy, and not forget to advertise the
Samaritan. That was at once her pleasure and
her duty.</p>

<p>If Papa Finkelstein’s suspicions endured
through the night, as I have my reasons for
believing they did endure, they found no permanent
lodgment in the bosom of his helpmate;
for the next morning an event occurred that for
the time being, at least, served to dispossess
Mamma Finkelstein’s mind of all lesser considerations.
I refer to the arrival of Miss
Godiva Sleybells, from the Cherry Hill Neighbourhood
House. Mrs. F. Fodderwood Bass
typified amateur philanthropy; but not so Miss
Sleybells. She came, panoplied with purposeful
intent, as the specialised, the expert, the
austere representative of systematic relief.</p>

<p><a name="p269" id="p269"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>269<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span>In a period not far remote the allegation had
been made that, so often, organised charity
was lacking in the personal and the direct touch.
It had been said that its common attitude was
this: if a starving man applied for help in the
guise of sustenance, organised charity took his
name and address and made a very painstaking
investigation of the merits of the mendicant
and his plea, sparing neither time nor expense
in the scope of its inquiry. His case being established
as a worthy one, organised charity
took steps to seek him out and providing he
had not inconsiderately died in the interim, or
moved to another park bench, it bestowed upon
him a small blue ticket entitling the holder to
saw wood so many hours a day at a specially
maintained wood yard, and to receive in return
for such labour a specified number of frugal
meals. Mind you I do not pretend to assume
that this actually was the fact; I merely repeat
a form of criticism current at one time. But
now, organised charity was become more personal
and possibly a trifle less statistical in its
methods. For proof, observe how promptly
Miss Godiva Sleybells moved. She, too, read
Miss Betty Gwin’s account of the lorn Finkelsteins.
She waited not for an inquisition to be
made and a report to be filed. She girded up
her walking skirt, as a result of which girding
it hiked in front and it drooped behind; and
she put on her heavy rubbers and she came.</p>

<p>She walked in, unannounced, on the
<a name="p270" id="p270"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>270<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>assembled Finkelsteins and the instant she crossed
the threshold all there, regardless of age, somehow
realised that they were hers to do with as
she pleased; realised that in her efficient hands
they would be but as plastic clay between the
fingers of the moulder. Everywhere she went
Miss Sleybells conveyed this feeling. It travelled
with her even as her aura. She could
walk through a crowded street, pausing not and
looking neither to the right nor the left and yet
leave behind her, in the minds of those among
whom she had passed, the firm conviction that
she had taken this particular street under her
direct management and control. Nay more.
She could traverse a stretch of empty landscape
and even after she was gone, inanimate nature
would somehow bear the impress of her dominance
as though thereafter the Original Creator
of that landscape would be relieved of all responsibility
in connection with its conduct,
maintenance and development. Were there
more like her in this hemisphere, woman would
not now be asking for the suffrage. But man
would be.</p>

<p>A variety of causes had actuated her in going
into settlement work. One half the world
didn’t know how the other half lived. Miss
Sleybells meant to find out. Already she had
written a considerable number of magazine
articles embodying the fruits of her observations
and deductions among the poor. Eventually,
from the rich stores of her knowledge she
<a name="p271" id="p271"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>271<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>meant to draw material for a novel. This novel
would be in the style of the best work of Gorky,
only stronger and more vivid than Gorky, and
infinitely rich in its analytical appraisals of
character. One who knew Miss Sleybells might
not doubt of this. If she had had a middle
name, her middle name would have been
Thoroughness<!-- original reads 'Throughness' -->.</p>

<p>Such, in brief, was the ardent and enthusiastic
woman who invaded the Finkelstein citadel,
surprising its resident garrison in the middle of
their comfortable untidiness and causing them
instantly and unconditionally to capitulate before
her onslaught. She looked about her,
choosing for her initial attack the point of least
resistance. It was the second to the youngest
Finkelstein, Lena by name, engaged at the
moment in regaling her infantile palate with a
mid-forenoon snack consisting of a large, sea-green
dill pickle and a rather speckly overripe
banana. By Mrs. Finkelstein’s standards these
two articles constituted a well-balanced food
ration. If the banana was soft and spotty, the
pickle certainly was firm and in the immature
hands of Lena practically indestructible. Besides,
the results spoke for themselves. Lena
liked her dill pickle and her banana; and she
thrived on them.</p>

<p>Miss Sleybells looked and said: “Tut! Tut!”
And with these words she deprived the startled
and indignant child of both those treasures.
That, however, was merely the beginning. She
<a name="p272" id="p272"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>272<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>fell to then in earnest&mdash;most expeditiously and
painstakingly fell to. From a neighbouring
lady, more addicted to the healthful exercise of
sweeping than Mamma Finkelstein was, she
commandeered the use of a broom; also a mop.
She heated water to the boiling point upon the
rickety stove. She gave little Miriam a quarter
and sent the child forth to buy two kinds of
soap&mdash;human and laundry. Following this
things ensued with a dizzying celerity.</p>

<p>At the outset, Miss Sleybells completely upset
Mamma Finkelstein’s domestic arrangements;
or, rather, she disturbed and disarranged
them, for to have them upset was
Mamma Finkelstein’s notion of having them
properly bestowed. She ferreted out from beneath
beds the stored accumulations of months.
She pried open the windows, admitting the chill
air of winter in swift gusts. She swept, she
dusted, and with suds she mopped the floor
and stayed not her hand. She herded the
abashed Finkelsteins into a corner, only to
drive them out again before the strokes of
broom and mop and dust rag, all the while tut-tutting
like a high-powered dynamo.</p>

<p>This done, she took individual after individual
in hand for cutaneal renovation. While
Mamma Finkelstein hovered timorously by,
stricken with a great and voiceless apprehension,
Miss Sleybells took scissors and snipped
the children out of their flannel swaddlings into
which they had so carefully been sewn but a
<a name="p273" id="p273"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>273<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>short six weeks before. As fast as she denuded
a submissive form she bathed it soapily, set it
before the fire to dry out, and seized, with moist,
firm grasp, upon another unresisting victim. I
indulge in no cheap effort at punning but speak
the sober fact when I say Miss Godiva Sleybells
that day proved herself a veritable Little
Sister of the Pore.</p>

<p>Presently from the group of small naked figures
squatted by the stove a sound of sneezing
arose. The baby began it and the baby’s example
was contagious. Soon these youthful
Finkelsteins who had undergone the water
ordeal, as contradistinguished from those who
had not yet undergone it, were going off with
sneezes at regular half-minute intervals, like
so many little pink cuckoo clocks.</p>

<p>Behind Miss Sleybells’ indomitable back,
then, Mamma Finkelstein wrung her hands in
mute and helpless distress. But no word of
protest did she utter. For one thing, her
knowledge of the English language practically
was negligible. For another thing, she dared
not speak even had she had the words. To
Mamma Finkelstein, Miss Sleybells personified
the visible authority of the state&mdash;that
same dread force which, in the guise of truant
officers, sought to drag Miriam away to public
school when her services were required for nursing
duties; and which, again, wearing brass
and blue, harried Solly from his wood-collecting
enterprises.</p>

<p><a name="p274" id="p274"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>274<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span>Starting with the youngest and progressing
toward the top, Miss Sleybells bathed up the
line as far as the twins before she stopped.
She stopped there for lack of living material.</p>

<p>Solly, opportunely, had fled into hiding, and
with him Miriam, his sister. Anyhow, Miss
Sleybells reflected, as she looked about her at
the surroundings, now all cleansed and dampish,
all lathered and purged, that she had done
a great deal for one day&mdash;a very great deal.
Still, much remained undone.</p>

<p>Upon leaving, she gave Mamma Finkelstein
express and explicit commands regarding the
conduct of her home, speaking with especial
reference to fresh air, ablutions and diet. By
nods and by gestures Mamma Finkelstein
pledged obedience, without sensing in the smallest
degree what she was promising to do. Then
Miss Sleybells announced that she would return
on the morrow, and departed. Mamma Finkelstein
understood that part, at least, and her
wigged head sank in her hands. Papa Finkelstein,
arriving home shortly before dark, sustained
a hard shock. For a minute he almost
thought he must have got into the wrong flat.</p>

<p>Miss Godiva Sleybells was as good as her
word; in fact, better. She did come back the
next day and on many days thereafter, coming
to correct, to admonish, to renovate, to set
erring feet upon the properest way, to scold
poor Mamma Finkelstein for her constantly
recurrent backslidings from the paths of
<a name="p275" id="p275"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>275<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>domestic duty. Nearly always she came at unexpected
intervals; and, having come, she
entered always without knocking. Mamma
Finkelstein fell into the habit of hearkening
fearsomely for the sound of footsteps in the hall
without.</p>

<p>Being warned by an approaching resolute
tread, betokening flat, low heels and broad,
sensible soles, she would drop whichever child
she happened to be mothering at that moment
and fly about in a perfect frenzy of purposeless
activity, snatching up things, casting them
aside, rattling kitchen pans, shoving loose
articles&mdash;and nearly everything she owned was
loose&mdash;out of sight. The artifice was a transparent
one at best. Assuredly it never deceived
Miss Godiva Sleybells. With shiftlessness
she had no patience. Shiftlessness was one
of several thousand things with which she had
no patience.</p>

<p>It was on the occasion of her second visit that
Miss Sleybells brought along and bestowed
upon Mamma Finkelstein a bound volume
dealing with the proper care of infants, and
bade her consult its pages. This gift Mamma
Finkelstein put to usage, but not the usage the
donor had devised for it. She gave it to the
next-to-the-youngest baby, who was teething,
to cut her little milk teeth upon. The sharp
corners proved soothing to the feverish gums
of Lena; but, under constant and well-irrigated
mumblings, the red dye on the covers came off,
<a name="p276" id="p276"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>276<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>resulting in an ensanguined appearance of
Lena’s lips and a sharp attack of colic elsewhere
in Lena. Mamma Finkelstein had suspected
evil lurked within the volume; now she was
certain dangers abode in its outer casings. She
kindled a fire with it.</p>

<p>It was on the occasion of her third visit that
Miss Sleybells brought with her two co-labourers
who listened intently and took notes
while their guide discoursed upon the subject
of the Finkelstein family’s domestic and
hygienic shortcomings, she speaking with the
utmost candour and just as frankly as though
her living topics had not been present at the
time.</p>

<p>It was following the occasion of her fourth
visit that Miss Godiva prepared and read to a
company of her associates in the Neighbourhood
House a paper dealing with her observations in
this particular quarter. In the course of her
reading she referred variously to the collective
Finkelsteins as a charge, a problem, a question,
an enigma and a noteworthy case.</p>

<p>For all her lack of acquaintanceship with the
language, it is possible that Mamma Finkelstein,
in her dim, inarticulate way, comprehended
something of Miss Godiva’s attitude
toward her. Perhaps she would have preferred
to be regarded not as a problem but occasionally
as a person. Perhaps she craved inwardly for
those vanished days of comparative privacy and
unlimited disorderliness within the two rooms
<a name="p277" id="p277"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>277<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>she called her home. Her situation may have
been miserable then. Miss Sleybells said so.
But what matters misery if its victims mistake
it for happiness?</p>

<p>But since Mrs. Finkelstein never by act or
sign or look betrayed her feelings, whatsoever
they may have been, it is not for me or for you
to assume that she harboured resentment.
She was a daughter of a tribe bitted and bridled
to silent endurance; of a people girthed and
saddled through the centuries to the uncomplaining
bearing of their burdens.</p>

<p>Meantime Mrs. F. Fodderwood Bass was by
no means slack in well-doing. As regards the
younger Finkelsteins particularly, her alms-deeds
were many. She took them under her
silken wings. At intervals she arrived, rustling,
to confer advice and other things more material
and therefore more welcome. She spoke of the
Finkelsteins as her Pet Charities.</p>

<p>Among the younger inmates of the flat her
visits were by no means distasteful. Quite
aside from the gifts she brought, the richness of
the clothes she wore appealed to a heritage of
their ancestry that was in them; they had a
natural taste and appreciation for fabrics. But
Papa Finkelstein found it impossible to cure
himself of his earlier suspicions. He remembered
what he remembered, and remained
dubious.</p>

<p>For all that, Mrs. F. Fodderwood Bass presently
aimed her batteries of benevolence upon
<a name="p278" id="p278"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>278<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>him. It was like this: She had aided conspicuously
in a Bundle Day movement. Someone
else, I believe, originated the idea, but Mrs. F.
Fodderwood Bass practically took it over as
soon as she heard about it. Through the daily
press an appeal was made to the well-to-do of
the community that they should assemble into
parcels their cast-off garments for distribution
among the poor. The police force, the fire department,
the express companies and the newspapers&mdash;all
were to cooperate in gathering up
such parcels and depositing them at a designated
central station, where the objects of this
bounty on a given date might be outfitted.</p>

<p>The notion caught the fancy and became
popular. It assumed a scope beyond the dream
horizon of its creator and of the legatees of the
notion; for in itself it had four elements that
inevitably appeal to the New York heart: first,
generosity, for New York may be thoughtless,
but it is vastly generous underneath its face-paint;
second, novelty; third, size; and fourth,
notoriety. But the greatest of these is notoriety.</p>

<p>The effects were magnificently far-reaching.
Thousands made contributions; thousands of
others profited thereby. Many a poor Bowery
“dinner waiter,” owning merely a greasy short
jacket and one paper-bosomed shirt, and compelled
therefore to serve in some quick order
place for his food and nothing else, secured,
without cost, the dress suit of his visions and
<a name="p279" id="p279"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>279<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>was in consequence enabled to get a regular
job, in a regular restaurant, with regular pay
and regular tips. Many a shivering derelict
got a warm if threadbare overcoat to cover him.
Many a half-clad child repaired to a big building
and there selected whole garments suitable
to his or her size, if not to his or her station.
And meanwhile the sponsors of the affair, including
Mrs. F. Fodderwood Bass and lesser
patronesses, looked on approvingly, acquiring
merit by the minute and, incidentally, long
reading notices in all the papers.</p>

<p>On the day before Bundle Day the lady
called in Pike Street, timing her arrival so as
to be sure of finding Papa Finkelstein in. With
the aid of Miriam and Solly she explained to
him her designs. He was to come to such and
such an address next morning and be equipped
with a wardrobe less accessibly ventilated to
the eager and the nipping air of winter than
the one he now possessed.</p>

<p>Papa Finkelstein solemnly pledged himself
to be there at the appointed hour, and so she
went away, well-content. Therein, however,
a subtle Oriental strain of duplicity in Papa
Finkelstein’s nature found play. He had no
intention of having his timid sensibilities massacred
before a large crowd to make a Bundle
Holiday. It may have been that he feared in
Mrs. F. Fodderwood Bass’ friendly overtures
there was concealed a covert campaign to proselyte
him away from the faith of the Fathers.
<a name="p280" id="p280"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>280<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>It may have been that, through professional
reasons, he privily deplored a movement calculated
to strike so deadly a blow at the very
vitals of the old-clo’ business. At any rate he
did not go where she had bade him go; completely
he absented himself therefrom.</p>

<p>It was late in the afternoon of the following
day before Mrs. F. Fodderwood Bass realised
that Papa Finkelstein had not yet appeared.
She called to her a footman of her employ,
specially detailed to attend her on this occasion,
and ordered him to proceed at once to Pike
Street and find her missing ward and bring
him before her. Being a good footman, his
expression gave no clue to his feelings. He
deemed it to lie far outside the proper functions
of a footman to be hunting up persons named
Finkelstein; but he obeyed.</p>

<p>For the moment the scene must shift to Pike
Street. The time is half an hour later. Partly
by words, partly by wide-armed gesticulations,
Papa Finkelstein explained his position in the
matter, if not his private reasons.</p>

<p>“Is that so?” said the footman, whose name
was Cassidy&mdash;Maurice J. Cassidy. He fixed a
strong hand grippingly in the back of Papa
Finkelstein’s collar. “Well, you listen to me,
young fella! Wan way or another you’re
goin’&mdash;wit’ me, nice and peaceable or in an
ambylance. You can make your own choice.”</p>

<p>The words possibly were confusing to the
alien understanding, but the large knobby fist,
<a name="p281" id="p281"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>281<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>which swayed to and fro an inch or so below
the tip of the captive’s nose, spoke in a language
that is understood of all men. Papa
Finkelstein saw his way clear to accompanying
Footman Cassidy. Aboard the street car, on
the way uptown, several of his fellow passengers
decided he must be a thief who had been caught
red-handed, and said it served him right.</p>

<p>Arriving, he was ushered&mdash;perhaps I should
say propelled&mdash;into the presence of Mrs. F.
Fodderwood Bass. She greeted his appearance
coosomely. Or is cooingly the right word?
At any rate, she cooed her approval; she cooed
beautifully, anyhow. With open pride she directed
the attention of certain of her associate
patronesses to the little huddled shape of Cassidy’s
prisoner.</p>

<p>“Ah, there he is!” she said. “My Pet
Charity! So improvident, so shiftless; but
isn’t he just too picturesque!”</p>

<p>Levelling their lorgnettes on him, her
friends agreed in chorus that he was very
picturesque. They wondered, though, why he
wriggled so.</p>

<p>“The dearest, gentlest little man!” continued
Mrs. F. Fodderwood Bass in clear, sweet
tones. “So diffident, but so grateful for everything&mdash;the
poor, tattered dear! He never says
a word to me when I talk to him; but by the
look in his eyes I can tell he is fairly worshipping
the ground I walk on.”</p>

<p>As if to prove the truth of what she said
<a name="p282" id="p282"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>282<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>Papa Finkelstein’s gaze even now was directed
upon the floor at her feet.</p>

<p>“Now, Cassidy,” went on his mistress, “you
take him into one of the dressing rooms yonder
and have him undress. It’s too bad nearly
everything has been picked over; but we shall
find something for him, I’m sure.”</p>

<p>Within a curtained recess Cassidy explained
his meaning with threatening mien.</p>

<p>“Take off thim rags!” he commanded.</p>

<p>Rags they may have been, but Papa Finkelstein
cherished them. Reluctantly he parted
with them, filled with the melancholy conviction
that he should see them never more. It
was a true foreboding. But that was not the
worst of it. Papa Finkelstein was in figure
slight and of a contour difficult to drape garments
upon. Moreover, it was as his benefactor
had said&mdash;everything had been picked
over so. Nevertheless, a selection agreeable to
the lady’s ideals was finally made.</p>

<p>Fifteen minutes passed. At the end of those
fifteen minutes Papa Finkelstein, under the
menacing urgings of Footman Cassidy, made a
diffident but spectacular reappearance before
the Bundle Day audience. His head was bent
apologetically low, so that his whiskers, spraying
upon his bosom, helped to cover him. His
two hands were spread flat upon his chest,
hiding still more of his abashed shape. Nevertheless,
it might be discerned that Papa Finkelstein
wore the abandoned cream-coloured
<a name="p283" id="p283"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>283<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>whipcords of somebody’s chauffeur&mdash;very abandoned
and very cream-coloured, the whole constituting
a livery, complete, from the visored cap upon
his head to the leather puttees reefed about his
bowed shanks.</p>

<p>“Now just look at him!” cried Mrs. F. Fodderwood
Bass in an ecstasy. “How neat!
How trim! How cosy!”</p>

<p>Papa Finkelstein didn’t want to be neat. He
abhorred cosiness; likewise trimness. Moreover
he shrunk mentally from the prospect of
his homeward journey, foreseeing difficulties.
There again was his intuition prophetically
justified.</p>

<p>At the corner of Hester Street and the Bowery
a skylarking group beheld him and greeted him
with cries of an almost incredulous joy. By
force they detained the little man, making
mock of him in English and in Yiddish. The
English passed over his head, but into his soul
the Yiddish bit deep, leaving scars. He wrested
himself free and fled to his home. His arrival
there made a profound impression on Mamma
Finkelstein&mdash;after she recognised him. So did
his language.</p>

<p>Only the absolute necessity of gleaning rent
money from the realms of trade drove him forth
two days later from the comparative sanctuary
of the inner room of his domicile. In the spirit
he suffered, and in the flesh as well. Citizens
en route to the Subway, on being hailed with
inquiries touching on old clothes, from an
<a name="p284" id="p284"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>284<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>undersized pedestrian attired as a chauffeur, in
reduced circumstances, who had neglected to
shave for a long time past, did not halt to listen.
They halted to laugh and to gibe and to gird
with derision. Until Papa Finkelstein had
effected a trade with a compassionate but
thrifty compatriot, with an utter disregard for
intrinsic values exchanging what he wore for
whatsoever the other might give, just so it
sufficiently covered him, he felt himself to be
a hissing and a byword in the highways&mdash;which
he was.</p>

<p>And now into the tangling skeins of the Finkelstein
family’s life in their relation to the
charitable impulses enlisted upon their behalf&mdash;but
without their consent or their approval&mdash;it
is fitting to reintroduce Miss Betty Gwin.
Springtime came and passed, its passage dappled
for all the Finkelsteins with memory spots
attesting the more or less intermittent attentions
of Mrs. F. Fodderwood Bass, and the more
or less constant ministrations of Miss Godiva
Sleybells.</p>

<p>Summer came; and with the initial weeks of
summer came also the time for the first of the
series of annual outings conducted under the
auspices of the <i>Evening Dispatch’s</i> Fresh Air
Fund for the Children of the Poor. Yearly it
was the habit of this enterprising sheet to give
excursions to the beach, employing therefor a
chartered steamboat and the contributions of
the public.</p>

<p><a name="p285" id="p285"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>285<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span>The public mainly put up the money; the
owner of the <i>Evening Dispatch</i>, Mr. Jason Q.
Welldover, principally took the credit, for
thereby, on flaunting banners and by word of
speech, was his name and his fame made glorious
throughout the land. As repeatedly
pointed out in the editorial columns of his
journal, the <span class="smc">Little Ones</span> of the slums were
enabled, through the <span class="smc">Generosity of This
Paper</span>, to breathe in the <span class="smc">Life-giving Ozone</span>
of kindly <span class="smc">Mother Ocean</span>; to <span class="smc">Play</span> upon the
sands; to <span class="smc">Disport</span> themselves in the very <span class="smc">Lap
Of Nature</span>; returning home at eventide <span class="smc">Rejuvenated</span>
and <span class="smc">Happy</span>&mdash;the phraseology and
the capitalisation alike being direct quotations
from the <i>Evening Dispatch</i>.</p>

<p>Since Miss Betty Gwin was on the staff of
the <i>Evening Dispatch</i>, it was quite natural that
she should take a personal pride as well as a professional
interest in the success of the opening
outing of the season. As suitable candidates
for admission to its dragooned passenger list she
thought of Miriam Finkelstein and Solly Finkelstein.
She pledged herself to see that these two
were included in the party. Nor did she forget
it. Upon the morning of the appointed date
she went personally to Pike Street, assumed
custodianship of the favoured pair and, her own
self, escorted them to the designated place of
assemblage and transferred them into the keeping
of Mr. Moe Blotch.</p>

<p>Mr. Blotch belonged in the <i>Evening
<a name="p286" id="p286"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>286<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>Dispatch’s</i> Circulation Department. Against his
will he had been drafted for service in connection
with the Fresh Air Fund’s excursion. He
was a rounded, heavy-set person, with the
makings of a misanthrope in him. That day
completed the job; after that he was a made
and finished misanthrope.</p>

<p>While murder blazed in his eyes and kind
words poured with malevolent bitterness from
his lips, Mr. Blotch marshalled his small charges,
to the number of several hundred, in a double
file. To each he gave a small American flag,
warning each, on peril of mutilation and death,
to wave that flag and keep on waving it until
further orders. Up at the head of the column,
Prof. Washington Carter’s All-Coloured Silver
Cornet Band struck up a clamorous march
tune and the procession started, winding its
way out of the familiar Lower East Side, across
the tip of Manhattan Island, to the verge of the
strange Lower West Side.</p>

<p>Well up in the line, side by side, marched
Miriam and Solly, the twain whose fortunes we
are following. Possibly from stress of joyous
anticipation they shivered constantly. However,
it was a damp and cloudy day, and, for
early June, very raw. Even Mr. Moe Blotch,
muffled as he was in a light overcoat, shivered.</p>

<p>The route of march led past the downtown
offices of the <i>Evening Dispatch</i>, where, in a
front window, the proprietor, Mr. Jason Q.
Welldover, waited to review the parade.
<a name="p287" id="p287"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>287<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>According to his instructions from a higher authority,
Mr. Blotch now gave the signal for an
outburst of appreciative cheering from the small
marchers. Obeying the command, they lifted
up their voices; but, doubtlessly through stage
fright or lack of chorus drilling, the demonstration,
considered for vocal volume, was not altogether
a success. It was plaintive rather than
enthusiastic. It resembled the pipings of despondent
sandpipers upon a distant lea. Standing
in the window, Mr. Welldover acknowledged
the tribute by bowing, he then holding the pose
until his staff photographers had caught him&mdash;once,
twice, three times.</p>

<p>Half a mile more of trudging brought the
little travellers to a dock above the Battery.
Alongside the dock lay a steamboat so swathed
in bunting and bannered inscriptions as to present
the appearance of being surgically bandaged
following a succession of major operations.
The smokestack suggested a newly broken leg,
enveloped in first-aid wrappings. The walking
beam rose above a red-and-white-and-blue mass,
like a sprained wrist escaping from its sling.
The boiler deck was trussed from end to end;
and everywhere recurred, in strikingly large
letters, the names of Mr. Jason Q. Welldover
and the <i>Evening Dispatch</i>.</p>

<p>Without loss of time, Mr. Blotch drove his
excursionists aboard; and soon then, to the
strains of martial music, the swaddled craft was
moving gayly down the river. Or, anyhow, she
<a name="p288" id="p288"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>288<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>moved as gayly as was possible, seeing that the
river was of a rumpled, grayish aspect, abounding
in large waves, and each wave flounced with
a ruffle of dirty-white foam; and seeing, further,
that an exceedingly keen wind blew dead
against her, searching out the remotest and
most sheltered recesses of her decks. Mr.
Blotch remained in the engine room throughout
the journey.</p>

<p>But all pleasant things must have an end;
and eventually, although to some aboard it
seemed even longer than that, the steamer
reached Coney. Somewhere on this globe there
may be a more dispiriting, more dismal spot
than Coney is on a wet and cloudy day in the
early part of June. I have heard Antarctic
explorers speak with feeling of the sense of desolation
inspired by contemplation of the scenery
closely adjacent to the South Pole; but, never
having been at or near the South Pole, I am still
pledged to Coney Island.</p>

<p>A hot dog merchant there, hearing the strains
of music and beholding the approach of a multitude,
lit his fires and laid specimens of his
wares upon the grid to brown and sizzle. A
closer view of the massed crowd, advancing
toward him from the pier, disillusioned him.
As a regular subscriber to the <i>Evening Dispatch</i>
he knew that these oncoming hosts were not to
be considered, even remotely, as prospective
patrons. For had it not been written and repeatedly
written that they were to be regaled,
<a name="p289" id="p289"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>289<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>ABSOLUTELY WITHOUT EXPENSE, at
Stanchheimer’s Chowder Pavilion? Verily it
had been so written. Uttering fluent maledictions
in his sonorous native Greek, the hot dog
man went inside his booth, pulled down the
shades and turned off the gas.</p>

<p>On a wide and windswept shore, where pallid
sands ran down to pallid sea, and sea in turn
ran out and out to mingle, under shrouding fog
banks, with lowering skies, the small Fresh-Air
funders were turned loose and sternly ordered to
enjoy themselves. Perversely, they persisted
in huddling in close, tight clusters, as though
drawn together by a gravitation of common discomfort.
Their conductor was not to be
thwarted. He had a duty to perform&mdash;a duty
to them and to his employer&mdash;and scrupulously
he meant to obey it if it cost forty lives. From
group to group Mr. Moe Blotch ran, yanking its
members out into the cheerless open.</p>

<p>“Play, consarn you! Play!” he blared at
them. “Laugh and sing and dig in the sands!
Breathe in the life-giving ozone or I’ll break
every bone in your bodies!”</p>

<p>Little Miriam found herself alone and lonesome
in the shadow of a depressingly pale-yellow
dune. She thought of the warm and comfortable
tenement hallway, crowded as it would
be with gossiping little deputy mothers and
crawling, babbling babies. She thought of the
shifting panorama of Pike Street’s sidewalk life,
spectacular and thrilling. She thought of her
<a name="p290" id="p290"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>290<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>own two special charges&mdash;Izzy and Izzy&mdash;deprived
now of their customary guardianship
and no doubt pining for it.</p>

<p>These poignant memories overcame her. She
lifted her face to the unresponsive vault of
heaven, and she wept. Once she was at it,
there was no false restraint in her weeping; she
bemoaned her lot shrilly, copiously and
damply. Moisture streamed from her eyes,
her mouth, her nose. In her rendition there
was a certain aquatic wholeheartedness that
would have interested and startled a student of
natural hydraulics. Practically this child had
riparian rights.</p>

<p>To her side came running Solly, her brother,
likewise weeping. His antlerlike ears, undefended
and, as it were, defiantly outbranching
to the edged breezes, were now two chilled
disks, shot through their more membranous
surfaces with bluish, pinkish, greenish tones,
like mother-of-pearl. His nose, from tip to
base, was one frigid and painful curve. And,
to top all, Solly, venturing too near the beach
edge, had been surprised by a quick, large
wave. From his waist down he dripped sea
water. His fortitude succumbed before this
final misfortune. He mingled his tears with
Miriam’s, substantially doubling the output.</p>

<p>Their sorrow might have touched a heart of
stone; but Mr. Blotch, embarking on this mission
of pleasure, had left his heart behind him,
foreseeing that its presence might be inconvenient
<a name="p291" id="p291"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>291<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>to a proper discharge of his philanthropic
obligations. He charged down upon them,
separated their entwined arms and, with terrible
threats, required them to play and dig in
the sand.</p>

<p>So they played and they dug in the sand.
Choking back their sobs and burying their
little, cold fingers in the cold, gritty sand, they
played and dug through the long forenoon until
dinnertime; and after dinner they dug and
played some more, until the hour for departure
arrived, cutting short all their blithesome
misery.</p>

<p>Beyond question, Solly next day would have
developed pneumonia, except that pneumonia
was far too troublesome a luxury for any of the
Finkelstein family to be having. Besides, at
this juncture the weather providentially turned
off to be warm and seasonable, and, scouting in
East Broadway, he happened upon a large,
empty crockery crate, which seemed to lack a
friend. He up-ended it, crawled inside it and
made off with it; and so completely hidden
was he within its capsized depths that one
observing the spectacle might have been excused
for assuming that a crockery crate was
out for a walk on its own account. In the joys
of perilous adventures and treasure-findings
Solly conquered his symptoms and forgot to
fall ill.</p>

<p>The weather continued to be warm and
warmer. By mid-July it was so warm that
<a name="p292" id="p292"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>292<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>the interior of the tenements became insufferable,
and the dwellers slept of nights on fire
escapes and in doorways, and even in the little
squares and out on the pavement gratings,
stretched&mdash;whole rows of them&mdash;upon pallets
and quilts. The hot spell afforded Miss Godiva
Sleybells an opportunity to do something that
was really worth while for the two older of the
eight younger Finkelsteins. She came one simmering
day and told them the splendid news.
They were to have a week&mdash;a whole week&mdash;on a
farm up in the Catskills.</p>

<p>With memories of Coney still vivid in their
young brains, Miriam and Solly inwardly
quailed at the prospect; but they went. There
was nothing else for them to do; the determined
dragoness in the double-lensed spectacles, who
managed their mother and condemned them at
intervals to trials by soap and water, had so ordained
it.</p>

<p>I wish I might say the two children were
wrong in their forebodings; I wish I might
paint their week in the Catskills as a climactic
success. Perhaps from Miss Godiva Sleybells’
viewpoint it was a success; but, remember, I
am concerned with detailing not her impressions
so much as the impressions of these small wards
of hers.</p>

<p>Remember, too, that in saying what I must,
as a truthful historian, say, I mean not to reflect
upon the common aims or the general results of
that splendid charity which each year sends
<a name="p293" id="p293"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>293<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>thousands of poor children to the country,
there for a spell to breathe in a better air than
ever they have breathed, and to eat of better
fare than ever they have eaten. In this instance
I am afraid the trouble was that the city
had trapped the small Finkelsteins too early.
If they had not been born in its stone-and-steel
cage, at any rate they could not remember a
time when they had not lived in it. They were
like birds, which, being freed, cannot use their
wings because they have never used them, but
only flutter about distractedly, seeking to return
to the old confines within the bars of the
prison and the familiar perches of its constricted
bounds. Distance&mdash;free, limitless and far-extending&mdash;daunts
those other birdlings as it
daunted these two small human ones. It was
so strange an experience to them to be thrust
into the real out-of-doors. And to most of us
whatever is strange is uncomfortable&mdash;until we
get accustomed to it.</p>

<p>The journey mountainward frightened the
small pair. They had never been on a train
before. As they clung to each other, cowering
low in their seat every time the locomotive
hooted, they resolved that willingly they would
never be on one again. Upon reaching their
destination they were required to sleep in separate
beds, which was an experience so very
different from the agreeable and neighbourly
congestion of sleeping four or five to a bed, as at
home. Next morning they were given for
<a name="p294" id="p294"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>294<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>breakfast country eggs and country milk&mdash;the
one fresh-laid by the hen; the other fresh-drawn
from the udder.</p>

<p>For Miriam and Solly it proved a most unsatisfactory
meal. This milk came from a cow,
whereas the milk they knew came from a milkman.
It was so yellow, so annoyingly thick, so
utterly lacking in the clear blue, almost translucent,
aspect of East Side milk! The Catskill
egg likewise proved disappointing. After the
infrequent Pike Street egg, with its staunchness
and pungency of flavour, it seemed but a weak,
spiritless, flat-tasting thing.</p>

<p>When breakfast was over they went forth
upon kindly compulsion from the farmhouse
kitchen and, barefooted, were turned loose on a
grassy mead. At once all Nature appeared in
a conspiracy against them. The wide reaches
of space disturbed them, whose horizon always
had been fenced in with tall, close-racked buildings.
The very earth was a pitfall, bearded
with harsh saw-edged grass blades, drenched
with chilly dews, and containing beneath the
ambush of its green covering many rough and
uneven depressions. The dew irritated Solly’s
naked legs, making him long for the soothing
contact of Pike Street’s mud-coated cobbles.
Miriam stubbed her shrinking pink toes against
hidden clods when she essayed a timorous step
or two forward. So both of them stood still,
then, very much at a loss to know what they
should or could do next.</p>

<p><a name="p295" id="p295"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>295<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span>Somebody suggested to Miriam that she
pick the wild flowers and the wild vine tendrils
and weave them into garlands. Was it her
fault that her very first selections should be a
spray of poisoned sumac, first cousin to poison
ivy, and that her second should be a handful of
nettles? Somebody else undertook to induct
Solly into the pleasures of tree climbing. Was
it altogether his fault that he should promptly
fall out of the first crotch and painfully sprain
and bruise himself in several places?</p>

<p>And when, finally, they had been induced to
quit the immediate proximity of the farmhouse,
which at least provided a refuge and a shelter
from suspected dangers, and had ventured over
a fence and into a pasture, a most terrible thing
occurred. Toward them there suddenly advanced
an enormous red creature, tossing a
huge head crowned with sharp horns, and emitting
frightful, rumbling sounds from a great
rubbery muzzle.</p>

<p>With shrieks of terror, they fled blindly into
a patch of woodland that was perhaps two acres
in extent; and, losing themselves in its&mdash;to them&mdash;vast
and impenetrable depths, they remained
there, crouching behind a tree until discovered,
tearful, hungry and disconsolate, by a volunteer
search party shortly before sunset. Miriam’s
subsequent description of the monster
that had menaced them, as detailed to her
mother, gave Mamma Finkelstein a mental
picture of something which might be likened
<a name="p296" id="p296"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>296<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>to a cross between a raging rhinoceros and a
hook-and-ladder motor truck. For it had been
many a year since Mamma Finkelstein herself
had seen a yearling heifer. And Miriam never
had seen one before.</p>

<p>It was indeed a hard and an irksome week.
The end of it saw the two small adventurers,
both sun-blistered and peeling, both broken
out as to hands and legs with strange, irritating
rashes, and both with gladness in their little
homesick souls, returning to the beloved perils
and the customary pleasures of the torrid town.</p>

<p>After this the Finkelsteins for a while had a
welcomed respite from kindness. They fairly
revelled in it; but not for a great while, nor, in
fact, for very long, did it endure. Following
Labor Day, Mrs. F. Fodderwood Bass came
back from her country place up Greenwich way
and reopened her city place. It transpired that
with her she had brought a perfectly splendid
idea. She was going to establish the Finkelsteins
on an abandoned farm. While motoring
about over the country lanes in Connecticut
she had found the very spot for them&mdash;an
ideal spot, indeed&mdash;nine acres, and nine miles
from a railroad, with a ruinous little cottage,
all furnished, perched upon a rocky hillock in
the centre of the nine acres.</p>

<p>It was upon this site she was resolved they
should be domiciled. There&mdash;as she herself
said&mdash;Papa Finkelstein might turn farmer and
maybe make a fortune. There Mamma Finkelstein
<a name="p297" id="p297"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>297<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>could rear her brood in peace and quiet,
far aloof and remote from the teeming multitude.
There the fresh, pure air of the country
would restore the bloom of health to the cheeks
of all the little Finkelsteins. What mattered
it though the little Finkelsteins were already so
healthy that if they had been any healthier
than they were it might have been necessary to
tap them for it? I am not detailing what was
actually the case, but what Mrs. F. Fodderwood
Bass, in the exuberance engendered by
her generous impulses, said about it.</p>

<p>A scheme so large required cooperation.
Mrs. F. Fodderwood Bass secured it from Miss
Godiva Sleybells, whom she had met upon
more than one occasion when the two of them
chanced to happen in upon the Finkelsteins at
the same time, and from Miss Betty Gwin,
who frequently had been called upon to detail to
a hungry reading public particulars concerning
Mrs. F. Fodderwood Bass’ social and charitable
endeavours.</p>

<p>Together these three constituted a committee
on ways, means and publicity. Mrs. F. Fodderwood
Bass provided the funds for leasing
the nine acres and for transporting its ten
future tenants to their future home. Miss
Godiva Sleybells agreed, for her part, to insure
that the prospective colonists, both big and
little, were properly loaded and properly
shipped to their destination. Miss Betty Gwin
wrote a moving word picture two columns
<a name="p298" id="p298"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>298<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>long about it, in which she mentioned the late
Baron de Hirsch once and Mrs. F. Fodderwood
Bass a great many times.</p>

<p>Actually the day preceding the day set for
the removal of the Finkelsteins arrived before
it occurred to the three conferees that they had
entirely forgotten until that minute to take
the Finkelsteins into their confidence&mdash;not that
it very much mattered; this was but an incidental
detail, which before now had been altogether
overlooked. Miss Sleybells volunteered
to go and tell them. She went and she did.</p>

<p>Reporting back to the principal factor in this
kindly little conspiracy, Miss Sleybells said
the Finkelstein family had been stunned&mdash;literally
stunned into dumb silence by the grateful
joy the tidings brought to them. She said surprise
and gratitude had left them absolutely
speechless. Naturally she had no way of knowing,
when she broke the glad news, that Solly
thought of Coney’s inhospitable sands and
treacherous seas; that Miriam thought of the
fearsome Catskill cow; that their mother,
whose whole life had been bounded by two
Ghettos&mdash;one in the Old World and one in the
New, and who knew no other life&mdash;thought of a
great variety of things; and that the children,
ranging from the twins downward, would have
done some thinking, too, had they been of suitable
age thus to indulge their juvenile intellects.</p>

<p>She had no way of knowing that, when she
was gone from among them, Papa Finkelstein
<a name="p299" id="p299"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>299<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>stood erect and, elevating his two hands in passionate
entreaty toward heaven, with solemn
fervour uttered the only words which it is fated
that we, in this recital, shall ever hear him utter.
He spake them in the tongue with which he was
most conversant. He said:</p>

<p>“<i>Gott bei heit!</i>”</p>


<p class="tb"><br class="ns"
 />September’s hurried twilight was folding in
upon Pike Street. Against the curbing, surrounded
by an admiring throng, stood Mrs. F.
Fodderwood Bass’ third-best car. Hard by
stood an express wagon, its driver ready to
receive what puny freightage of household and
personal belongings as might be consigned to his
care. And upstairs, upon the top floor of a
certain tenement, in the narrow hall outside the
Finkelstein flat, stood Mrs. F. Fodderwood
Bass, Miss Godiva Sleybells and Miss Betty
Gwin. The first named of these three was
come to witness the accomplishment of her
beautiful purpose; the second, to lend her
executive abilities to the details of the undertaking;
the third, to write a piece about it.</p>

<p>In accord with her regular habit Miss Sleybells
turned the knob. The knob turned part
way, but the door did not open; so she rattled
the knob and knocked with her knuckles on the
panel. Mrs. F. Fodderwood Bass raised her
flutelike voice in cooing accents.</p>

<p>“Open the door, my dear charities,” she said
clearly. “It is I&mdash;your good angel.”</p>

<p><a name="p300" id="p300"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>300<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span>Miss Betty Gwin stooped and applied a
squinted eye at the keyhole. Miss Sleybells
knocked again&mdash;harder. There was no answer.</p>

<p>I shall tell you why there was no answer.
The reason is a good and sufficient one. All
day within their two rooms the Finkelstein
family had bided, waiting, waiting; hoping
against hope. With the sound of well-remembered
footsteps in the hall without, with the
sound of a well-known voice uplifted, the last
faint remnant of hope expired.</p>

<p>In melancholy resignation Papa Finkelstein
nodded to Mamma Finkelstein; and Mamma
Finkelstein, stifling the plaint of the youngest
baby in her shawl, nodded back to him in sorrowful
confirmation of the worst. With gestures
he imposed deep silence upon all present.
He tiptoed into the rear room and his people
followed, tiptoeing also. He climbed out of the
back window and descended the fire-escape ladder
to the fire-escape landing at the level of
the next floor below. He balanced himself
there and into his extended arms, Mamma
Finkelstein passed down to him, one by one,
their children; and he, in turn, passed them in
at a window where Mrs. Esther Rabinowitz, a
good-hearted neighbour, received them, and
deposited them in a mute row upon her kitchen
floor. At the last Mamma Finkelstein descended
and joined him.</p>

<p>They assembled their progeny. They noiselessly
emerged from Mrs. Rabinowitz’ hall door;
<a name="p301" id="p301"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>301<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>and, noiselessly all, they fled down the stairs and
out into the gathering twilight of Pike Street,
which has a way of growing shabby and soiled-looking
as it gathers. They had deserted all
their small belongings; they knew not where
that night they might lay their heads; they
had no idea where they were going&mdash;but they
were on their way.</p>


<p class="tb"><br class="ns"
 />Up on the top floor Miss Sleybells knocked
and knocked again. Miss Gwin put her ear
to the locked, barred door and listened and
listened for betraying sounds within; and
Mrs. F. Fodderwood Bass raised her coo to
yet a flutier pitch. And while they were thus
engaged the Finkelstein family, one and all,
vanished into the cloaking, protecting dusk
where Pike Street runs toward the river.</p>

<p>Did I say Finkelstein family? I was wrong
there.</p>

<p>For purposes of better concealment Papa
Finkelstein had changed the name. The inspiration
had come to him even as he gripped
the topmost round of the fire-escape ladder.
Changing it, he had seen fit to honour, by virtue
of self-adoption, a race of Irish kings, and notably
a policeman of his acquaintance, a descendant
of that kingly line. He changed it to
Finnigan. Loss to the Finkelsteins would
thenceforth be gain to the Finnigans.</p>

<p>So they vanished away&mdash;Papa Meyer Finnigan,
Mamma Leah Finnigan&mdash;née Pincus&mdash;Miriam
<a name="p302" id="p302"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>302<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>Finnigan, Solly Finnigan, the Finnigan
twins, Izzy and Izzy; Benjamin Finnigan, Rebecca
Finnigan, Lena Finnigan, and so on down
to Baby Leopold Finnigan&mdash;and were gone!</p>

<p>For does it not stand written <span class="nw">that&mdash;&mdash;</span>? But
see Corinthians&mdash;first, thirteenth and fourth&mdash;and
notably the first three words of the same.
Only it should have been written there, in amplification,
that there is a limit.</p>

 </span>CHAPTER VIII<br
 /><span class="so">ENTER THE VILLAIN</span></h2>


<p class="newchap"><span class="dropcap ml6">It is</span> conceded, I believe, that every story
should have a moral; also, whenever possible,
a heroine or a hero, a villainess or a
villain, a plot and a climax. Now this
story has a villain of sorts, if you choose to
look upon him in that light; but no hero, and
no climax. And certainly there is no moral to
adorn the tale. So far as I have been able to
discover it is absolutely moral-less. So then,
reader, if you, being thus foreadvised regarding
these avowed shortcomings of my narrative,
choose to go further with it, the responsibility
must be yours and not mine. Don’t you come
round afterward saying I didn’t warn you.</p>

<p>The rise of the curtain discloses the city
room of <i>The Clarion</i>, a New York morning newspaper.
The hour is six-thirty <span class="allsc">P.&nbsp;M.</span>, the period
is the approximate present, and the season is
summer time. At a desk in the foreground is
discovered the head office boy in the act of
scissoring certain marked passages out of
<a name="p304" id="p304"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>304<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>copies of the afternoon papers and impaling
them upon spindles. Beyond him, at a big
oaken table shaped like half of a pie, a lone
copy reader is humped in his chair, chewing on
a cold pipestem and editing a bad piece of copy
with a relentless black lead. In this case the
copy reader is named Hemburg. He is of a
type of which at least one example is to be
found in nearly every large newspaper shop&mdash;a
competent failure, gone alcoholically to seed;
usually holding down a desk job; rarely quite
drunk and rarely quite sober, and in this mid-state
of befuddlement performing his work with
a strange mechanical accuracy; but once in a
while he comes on duty cold sober&mdash;cause unknown&mdash;and
then the chances are he does something
unpardonably wrong, something incredibly
stupid, which costs him his job. Just such
a man is this present man Hemburg. As, shoving
his pencil, he carves the very giblets out of
the last sheet of the belated typewritten manuscript
lying under his hand, the sunlight, slanting
in at a west window behind him, falls over
his shoulders in a streaked flood, making his reddened
face seem redder than ever&mdash;as red as
hearth paint&mdash;and turning his ears a bright,
clear, pinkish colour, as though they might be
two little memorial panes set there in dedication
to the wasted life and the frittered talents
of their owner.</p>

<p>Farther up stage the city-hall reporter, who
because he has passed his fortieth birthday and
<a name="p305" id="p305"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>305<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>has grey in his hair is known as Pop, and the
ship-news reporter, who because he is the ship-news
reporter is known as Skipper, the same as in
all well-regulated newspaper offices, are pasting
up their strings, both of them being space men.
Otherwise the big bare room with its rows of
desks and its scrap-strewn floor is quite empty.
This hour, coming between six and seven, in the
city room of <i>The Clarion</i> or any other big paper,
is apt to be the quietest of all hours between
starting time, early in the afternoon, and quitting
time, early in the morning. The day city
editor, having finished his stint, has gone off
watch, leaving behind for his successor, the
night city editor, a single scrawled sheet upon
which is recorded the tally of things accomplished,
things undertaken and things failed
at. The reporters who got afternoon assignments
have most of them turned in their stories
and have taken other assignments which will
keep them out of the office until much later.
So almost an ecclesiastical quiet fills the city
room now.</p>

<p>For the matter of that, it is only in the dramatic
versions that a newspaper office ever attains
the aspect of frenzied tumult so familiar
and so agreeable to patrons of plays purporting
to deal with newspaper life. As usually depicted
upon the stage, a city room near press
time is something like a skating rink, something
like the recreation hall of a madhouse, something
like a munitions factory working overtime
<a name="p306" id="p306"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>306<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>on war orders, and nothing at all like a
city room. Even when its manifold activities
are in full swing the actual city room, save for
the click of typewriter keys, is apt to be as sedately
quiet as&mdash;let’s see now! What would
make a suitable comparison? Well&mdash;as sedately
quiet, say, as the reading room of the
average Carnegie Library.</p>

<p>Six-thirty-four&mdash;enter the villain.</p>

<p>The practical door at the right opened and
Mr. Foxman came in. In just what he stood
in he might have posed for the typical picture of
the typical New York business man; not the tired
business man for whom the musical shows are
supposed to be written but the kind of business
man who does not tire so easily. A close-cropped,
greyish moustache, a pair of nose
glasses riding a short, pugnacious nose in front
of two keen eyes, a well-knit middle-age shape
inside of a smart-fitting suit, a positive jaw, an
air of efficiency and a square shoulder&mdash;that
briefly would be Mr. Hobart Foxman, managing
editor of <i>The Clarion</i>.</p>

<p>His nod included the city-hall reporter and the
ship-news man. Passing by Hemburg without
speaking, he halted a minute alongside the desk
where the head copy boy speared his shearings
upon his battery of spindles.</p>

<p>“Singlebury come in yet?” asked Mr. Foxman.</p>

<p>“No, sir; not yet, sir,” said the head copy
boy. “But he’s due any minute now, I guess.
<a name="p307" id="p307"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>307<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>I phoned him you wanted to see him at a
quarter to seven.”</p>

<p>“When he comes tell him to come right into
my office.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; I’ll tell him, sir.”</p>

<p>“Did you get those envelopes out of the
morgue that I telephoned you about?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; they’re all four of ’em on your
desk, sir,” said the boy, and he made as though
to get up from his seat.</p>

<p>“Never mind,” said Mr. Foxman. “I guess
I can find them without any help. &hellip; Oh,
yes, Benny, I’m not to be disturbed during the
next hour for anything. Nobody is to see me
except Singlebury. Understand?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir&mdash;nobody,” said Benny. “I’ll remember,
sir.”</p>

<p>Inside his own room, which opened directly
upon the city room, Mr. Foxman brushed from
his desk a neatly piled file of the afternoon
papers, glanced through a heap of mail&mdash;some
personal mail, but mostly official&mdash;without
opening any of the letters, and then gave his
attention to four big soiled manila envelopes
which rested side by side upon his wide blue
blotter pad. One of these envelopes was
labelled, across its upper front, “Blake, John
W.”; the second was labelled “Bogardus,
S.&nbsp;P.”; the third, “Pratt, Ezra”; and the
fourth, “Pearl Street Trolley Line.” Each of
the four bulged dropsically with its contents,
which contents, when Mr. Foxman had bent
<a name="p308" id="p308"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>308<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>back the envelope flaps and emptied the envelopes,
proved to be sheafs of newspaper clippings,
some frayed with handling and yellowed
with age, some still fresh and crisp, and all
bearing the stencilled identification mark of the
functionary who runs what is called in some
shops the obit department and in other shops
the morgue.</p>

<p>Keeping each set in its own separate pile,
Mr. Foxman began running through these
clippings, now and then putting aside one for
future consideration. In the midst of this he
broke off to take up his desk telephone and,
when the girl at the private switchboard upstairs
answered, bade her ring for him a certain
private number, not to be found in the
telephone directory.</p>

<p>“That you, Moreau?” briskly asked Mr.
Foxman when, after a short wait, a voice at the
other end of the wire spoke. “How are you? &hellip;
Quite well, thank you. &hellip; I want to
speak with the general. &hellip; Yes, yes, yes, I
know that, but this is important&mdash;very important. &hellip;
Yes, I know that too; but I won’t
detain him but a minute. &hellip; Thanks. &hellip;
Yes, I’ll wait right here.”</p>

<p>There was another little delay while Mr.
Foxman held the receiver to his ear and kept
his lips close to the transmitter. Then:</p>

<p>“Good evening, general&mdash;Foxman speaking.”</p>

<p>Into the managing editor’s tone was come a
soothed and softened deference&mdash;something of
<a name="p309" id="p309"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>309<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>the same deference which Benny, the head office
boy, had used in addressing Mr. Foxman. It
was a different tone, very, from the sharpened,
almost staccato note that Mr. Foxman had been
employing but a minute before. Why not?
Moreau was but the great man’s private secretary
and this man, whom now he addressed,
was the great man himself&mdash;General Robert
Bruce Lignum, sole proprietor of <i>The Clarion</i>&mdash;and
the only person, barring himself, from whom
Mr. Foxman took orders. Big fleas, you know,
have smaller fleas which on them prey; but
while preying, the little fleas, if they be little
fleas wise in their own generation, are, I take
it, likely to cultivate between bites and to use
that flattering conversational accent which, the
world over, is the most subtle tribute that may
be paid by the smaller to the greater and by the
greater to the most great. In this agreeably
tempered tempo then Mr. Foxman continued,
with pauses for his employer’s replies.</p>

<p>“Sorry, general, to have to call you just as
you’re starting for the pier, but I was particularly
anxious to catch you before you left
the house.” Instinctively he lowered his voice,
although there was no need for any excess of
caution. “General, I think I’ve got that trolley-grab
exposé practically lined up. Bogardus told
me this afternoon that the third man&mdash;you know
the one I mean&mdash;is ready to talk. It looks to
me like a bigger thing even than we thought it
might be. It’s a scurvy crew we’re dealing
<a name="p310" id="p310"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>310<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>with, but the end justifies the means. Don’t
you think so, sir? &hellip; Yes, that’s right, too&mdash;when
thieves fall out honest men get their due. &hellip; Sir? &hellip; Yes,
that’s my idea, too&mdash;to
spring the first big story right out of a clear
sky and then follow up with an editorial campaign
and supplementary news stories until we
get action in the district-attorney’s office. &hellip; How’s
that, sir? &hellip; Oh, no, indeed, general,
not the slightest particle of danger in my
opinion. Personally, I think all this talk about
floating mines and submarines has been greatly
exaggerated. &hellip; I think you can go right
ahead in perfect safety. You must know, general,
that I wouldn’t be giving you this advice
if I thought there was the slightest danger. &hellip; Well,
good-by, general, and pleasant voyage. &hellip; Oh,
yes, indeed, I’ll surely find some way
of keeping you posted about the situation at
Albany if anything develops in that quarter. &hellip; Well,
good-by again, general.”</p>

<p>He hung up the receiver and turned his hands
again to the contents of the morgue envelopes.
He was still at this when there came at his door
a knock.</p>

<p>“Come in,” he said without looking up.</p>

<p>The man who entered was tall and slender,
young enough to be well this side of thirty and
old enough, in his experiences, to wear that
manner of schooled, appraising disillusionment
which marks so many of his calling. Most
good reporters look like good reporters; they
<a name="p311" id="p311"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>311<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>radiate from them knowledge, confidence, skepticism,
sometimes a little of pessimism, and
always a good deal of sophisticated enthusiasm.
It is the same air which goes with men, be their
separate callings what they may, who have devoted
their lives to prying open the lid of the
world to see what makes the thing tick. They
have a curiosity not only to see the wheels go
round but to find out what the motive power
behind and beneath the wheels may be.</p>

<p>Never mind what the after-dinner speaker
says&mdash;the press is not an Archimedean lever
and probably never was. It is a kit containing a
cold chisel, a test acid, an assay chemical and a
paint-box. Generally the users of this outfit
bear themselves accordingly. Once in a while,
though, there comes along a reporter who deceivingly
resembles a rather stupid, good-natured
plumber’s helper dressed in his Sunday
best. To look at him he seems as plain as an
old shoe, as open as an old shoe too. But if
you have something to hide from the public
gaze, beware this person. He is the most dangerous
one of them all. His business being
everybody’s business, he is prepared to go to any
ends to dig it out. As a professional detective
he could make himself famous. He prefers to
remain a journeyman reporter.</p>

<p>“Take a chair, Singlebury,” said Mr. Foxman;
“I’ll be through here in just a minute.”</p>

<p>Singlebury sat down, glancing about him. It
was the first time he had seen this room. He
<a name="p312" id="p312"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>312<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>had been on <i>The Clarion’s</i> staff less than a
month, having come on from the West, where
he served the years of his apprenticeship on
a San Francisco daily. Presently his chief
swivelled half round so as to face him.</p>

<p>“Young man,” he said, “I’ve got a cracking
good assignment for you&mdash;one that ought to
put you in right, in this shop and this town.
Ordinarily this job would go to Shesgren&mdash;he
usually handles this sort of thing for me&mdash;but
Shesgren is up at Albany keeping his eye on
General Lignum’s political fences, and I don’t
want to call him back, especially as the general
is leaving the country to-night. Besides you
did a good job of work last week on that Oskarson
baby-stealing mystery, and so I’ve decided
to give you a chance to swing this story.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, sir,” said Singlebury, flushing
up a little. “I’ll do my best, sir.”</p>

<p>“Your best won’t do&mdash;you’ve got to do better
than your best. Did you ever hear, since
you came to this town, of the Pearl Street
trolley line or the Pearl Street trolley loop?”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Singlebury, “I know there is
such a line as the Pearl Street line. That’s
about all.”</p>

<p>“That needn’t hamper you,” said Mr. Foxman.
“I’d a little rather you went at this
thing with an open mind, anyhow. These clippings
here”&mdash;he tapped one heap of them with
his forefinger&mdash;“ought to give you a pretty clear
idea of the situation in the past, if you’ll read
<a name="p313" id="p313"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>313<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>’em through carefully. They’ll show you that
the Pearl Street line has been a sort of financial
football for certain interests down in Wall
Street for a good many years. The fellows
behind it starved it to death and let the equipment
run down while they juggled the paper
and skinned the dear public.”</p>

<p>“I see,” said Singlebury; “same old story&mdash;plenty
of water for the road but no solid nourishment
for the investors.”</p>

<p>“That’s a good line,” commended Mr. Foxman;
“better save it up for your story and use
it there. But it’s not the same old story over
again. At least this time there’s a new twist to
it.</p>

<p>“Up until now the crowd that have been
manipulating the stock stayed inside the law,
no matter what else they may have done that
was shady. But I have cause to believe that a
new gang has stepped in&mdash;a gang headed by
John W. Blake of the Blake Bank. You’ve
heard of him, I guess?”</p>

<p>Singlebury nodded.</p>

<p>“It’s been known for some time on the inside
that the Blake outfit were figuring on a merger
of some of the independent East Side surface
lines&mdash;half a dozen scattered lines, more or less.
There’ve been stories printed about this&mdash;we
printed some of them ourselves. What hasn’t
been known was that they had their hooks
into the Pearl Street line too. Poor outcast as
it is, the Pearl Street line, with the proposed
<a name="p314" id="p314"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>314<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>Pearl Street loop round Five Points&mdash;a charter
was granted for that extension some time ago&mdash;will
form the connecting link to the combination
they’re figuring on. And then on top of
that there’s the direct connection to be made
with the new Brooklyn subway that’s being
built now. If you’ll look at the map of the
East Side lines you’ll see for yourself how important
it is for the group that intends to take
control of the trolley lines on this side of the
river and hopes to control the subway to the
other side of the river that they should have the
Pearl Street loop in their grip. With it they
win; without it there’s doubt of the success of
their plan.</p>

<p>“Well, that part of it is legitimate enough, I
suppose. The common stock of the Pearl
Street line has been shoved down and down and
down, until to-day it touched twenty. And
Blake’s crowd on the quiet have been buying it
in&mdash;freezing out the small stockholders as they
went along, and knowing mighty good and well
that the day they announced their merger the
stock would go up with a jump&mdash;thirty or forty
or fifty points maybe&mdash;and then they’d clean
up. Well, I suppose that’s legitimate too&mdash;at
least it’s recognised as regular on Wall Street,
provided you can get away with it. But behind
the scenes there’s been some outright,
downright, grand larceny going on and, along
with that, legislative corruption too.</p>

<p>“The stealing has been covered up so far,
<a name="p315" id="p315"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>315<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>under a blanket of legal embroidery and fancy
phraseology. Trust a wise outfit of lawyers,
like the outfit Blake has on his pay roll, to
attend to those little details. But I have reason
to believe, having got hold of the inside
story from strictly private sources, that the
gang now in control have laid themselves liable
to prison sentences by a few of the tricks
they’ve pulled off. For instance, they haven’t
let a little thing like bribery stand in their
way. They weren’t satisfied to stifle a competitive
interest politely and quietly, according
to the Wall Street standards. No; these
thugs just naturally clubbed it to death. I
guess they saw so much in it for themselves
they took a long chance on being indicted if
the facts ever came out. And I happen to
know where we can get the facts if we go about
it in the right way. Listen, carefully!”</p>

<p>For five minutes he talked on, expounding
and explaining in straightaway, sharp sentences.
And Singlebury, on the edge of his chair, listening,
felt the lust of the big-game hunter quicken
within him. Every real reporter is a big-game
hunter at heart, and the weapon he uses frequently
is a deadly one, even though it is nothing
more than a lead pencil costing five cents at
any stationery shop. The scent was in his
nose now, dilating his nostrils; he wriggled to
take the trail.</p>

<p>“Now, then, you’ve got the inside dope, as I
get it myself,” said Mr. Foxman at the end of
<a name="p316" id="p316"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>316<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>those pregnant five minutes. “You can see for
yourself, though, that a good deal of it&mdash;the
vital part of it as it stands now&mdash;is mostly surmise
and suspicion. Naturally, we can’t go to
the bat against this gang with suspicions; we’d
probably land in jail ourselves for criminal libel,
instead of landing a few of them in jail, as we
hope to do. But if we can prove up&mdash;if we
can get hold of the rest of the evidence&mdash;it’ll
make one of the sweetest beats that was ever
pulled off in this town.</p>

<p>“Of course, as you can see, John W. Blake is
the principal figure in the whole intrigue, just
as the Pearl Street line is the key to the merger
scheme. But you stay away from Blake.
Don’t go near him&mdash;yet. If he gets wind of
what we are figuring on doing here in this office
he might have influence enough to make
trouble for us before we’re ready for the big
blow-off. Leave Blake out of it for the time
being&mdash;leave him strictly alone! He can do
his talking and his explaining after we’ve
smoked the nigger out of the woodpile. But
here are two other men”&mdash;he touched the remaining
piles of sorted-out clippings&mdash;“who
are willing, under cover, to indulge in a little
conversation. I want you to read these morgue
clippings, more to get an angle on their personalities
than for any other reason. Bogardus&mdash;Samuel
P. Bogardus&mdash;used to be Blake’s best
little trained performing lobbyist. When it
comes to handling the members of a general
<a name="p317" id="p317"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>317<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>assembly or a board of aldermen he’s fuller of
cute tricks than a clown dog is. Old Pratt is a
different kind of crook&mdash;a psalm-singing, pussyfooted
old buccaneer, teaching a Bible class on
Sundays and thimblerigging in Wall Street on
week days. As a Pharisee who’s working at
the trade he’d make any Pharisee you ever ran
across out yonder on the Pacific Slope, where
you came from, look like a piker.</p>

<p>“Well, for reasons best known to themselves
they happen just at present to be sore at Blake.
There’s been a falling-out. He may have used
them to do his dirty work in the past; and
then, when this melon is ripe to cut, frozen
both of them out of the picnic. I don’t care
anything about their quarrels, or their motives
either; I am after this story.</p>

<p>“Now, then, here’s your campaign: You
take to-night off&mdash;I’ll tell the night city editor
I’ve assigned you on a special detail&mdash;and you
spend the evening reading up on these clippings,
so you’ll have the background&mdash;the local colour
for your story&mdash;all in your head. To-morrow
morning at ten o’clock you go to the Wampum
Club up on East Fiftieth Street and send your
name in to Mr. Bogardus. He’ll be waiting
there in a private room for you, and old Pratt
will be with him. We’ll have to keep them
under cover, of course, and protect them up to
the limit, in exchange for the stuff they’re willing
to give up to us. So you’re not to mention
them as the sources of any part of your
<a name="p318" id="p318"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>318<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>information. Don’t name them in your story or to
anybody on earth before or after we print it.
Take all the notes you please while you’re with
them, but keep your notes put away where
nobody can see ’em, and tear ’em up as soon
as you’re done with ’em. They’ll probably
keep you there a couple of hours, because they’ve
got a lot to tell, son; take it from me they have.
Well, say they keep you three hours. That’ll
give you time to get your lunch and catch the
subway and be down town by two-thirty.</p>

<p>“At three o’clock to-morrow afternoon you
go to the law offices of Myrowitz, Godfrey, Godfrey
&amp; Murtha in the Pyramid Building on
Cedar Street. Ask to see Mr. Murtha. Send
your name in to him; he’ll be expecting you.
Murtha is in the firm now, but he gets out on
the fifteenth&mdash;four days from now. There’s
been a row there, too, I believe, and the other
partners are shoving him out into the cold.
He’s sore. Murtha ought to be able to tell the
rest of what you’ll have to know in order to
make our story absolutely libel proof. It may
take some digging on your part, but he’ll come
through if you only go at him the right way. In
questioning him you can probably take your
cues from what Bogardus and Pratt have already
told you. That end of it, though, is up
to you.  Anyhow, by this time to-morrow
night you ought to have your whole story
lined up.”</p>

<p>“Do you want me to come back here then and
<a name="p319" id="p319"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>319<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>write it for the next morning?” asked Singlebury.</p>

<p>“I don’t want you to write it here at all,”
said Mr. Foxman. “This thing is too big and
means too much for us to be taking a chance on
a leak anywhere. Have you got a quiet room
to yourself where nobody can break in on you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” said Singlebury. “I’m living at
the Godey Arms Hotel.”</p>

<p>“All right then,” said Mr. Foxman. “You
rent a typewriter and have it sent up to your
room to-morrow morning. When you are
ready to start you get inside that room and sit
down at that typewriter with the door locked
behind you, and you stay there till you’ve
finished your yarn. You ought to be able to do
it in a day, by steady grinding. When you’re
done tear up all your notes and burn the scraps.
Then put your copy in a sealed envelope and
bring it down here and deliver it to me, personally,
here in this room&mdash;understand? If
I’m busy with somebody else when you get
here wait until I’m alone. And in the meantime,
don’t tell the city editor or any member
of the staff, or your closest friend, or your best
girl&mdash;if you’ve got one&mdash;that you are working
on this story. You’ve not only got to get it
but you’ve got to keep your mouth shut while
you’re getting it and after you’ve got it&mdash;got to
keep mum until we print it. There’ll be time
enough for you to claim credit when the beat
is on the street.”</p>

<p><a name="p320" id="p320"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>320<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span>“I understand, sir,” said Singlebury. “And
I’m certainly mighty grateful to you, Mr. Foxman,
for this chance.”</p>

<p>“Never mind that,” said Mr. Foxman.
“I’m not picking you for this job because I like
the colour of your hair, or because I’m taken
by the cut of your clothes. I’m picking you
because I think you can swing it. Now, then,
go to it!”</p>

<p>Singlebury went to it. With all his reporter’s
heart and all his reporter’s soul and, most
of all, with all his reporter’s nose he went to it.
Tucked away in a corner of the evening edition’s
art room, deserted now and dark except
for the circle of radiance where he sat beneath
an electric bulb, he read and reread the scissorings
entrusted to him by Mr. Foxman, until his
mind was saturated with the subject, holding in
solution a mass of information pertaining to the
past activities of the Pearl Street trolley line
and of John W. Blake, freebooter of big business;
and of Ezra Pratt, class leader and financier;
and of S. P. Bogardus, statesman and
legislative agent.</p>

<p>It was nearly midnight before he restored each
group of clippings to its proper envelope and
took the envelopes to a grated window behind
the library and handed them in to a youth
on duty there. First, though, he took time,
sitting there in the empty art room, to write a
short, joyous letter to a certain person in San
Jose, California, telling her the big chance had
<a name="p321" id="p321"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>321<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>come to him very much sooner than he had
expected, and that if he made good on it&mdash;as
he had every intention of doing&mdash;they might
not, after all, have to wait so very long for that
marriage license and that wedding and that
little flat here in little old New York. Then he
went uptown to the Godey Arms Hotel, where
his dreams that night were such dreams as an
ambitious young man very much in love with
two sweethearts&mdash;one a profession and the
other a girl&mdash;might be expected to dream under
such circumstances.</p>

<p>Next morning, at the Wampum Club, he
saw Bogardus, a grey-haired, rotund man, and
Pratt, an elderly gentleman, with a smile as
oily as a fish duck’s apprehending minnows,
and a manner as gentle as a fox’s stalking a
hen-roost. From these two he extracted all
that he had expected to get and more besides.
Indeed, he had but to hold out his hands and
together they shook fruity facts and fruitier
figures down upon him in a shower. Until
nearly two o’clock they kept him with them.
He had just time to snatch a hurried bite at a
dairy lunch, board a subway express at the
Grand Central, and be at the offices of Myrowitz,
Godfrey, Godfrey &amp; Murtha at three
o’clock. A sign painter was altering the firm’s
name on the outer door of the firm’s reception
room, his aim plainly being to shorten it by the
elimination of the Murtha part of it. On beyond
the door the gentleman who thus was
<a name="p322" id="p322"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>322<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>being eliminated received Singlebury in a private
room and gave him nearly two hours of his
valuable time.</p>

<p>From what Mr. Foxman had said Singlebury
rather expected Mr. Murtha, at the outset,
might be reluctant to furnish the coupling links
between the legal chicanery and the financial
skullduggery which would make this projected
merger a conspicuous scandal in a district of
conspicuous industrial scandals; had rather
expected Mr. Murtha’s mind might require
crafty sounding and skillful pumping. Here
Singlebury was agreeably surprised, for, it
being first understood that Mr. Murtha’s name
was nowhere to appear in what Singlebury
might write, Mr. Murtha proved to be as frank
as frank could be. Indeed, when it came to a
disclosure of the rôles played by two of his
associates, from whom now he was parting,
Mr. Murtha, the retiring member of this well-known
house of corporation law, betrayed
an almost brutal frankness. They, doubtlessly,
would have called it rank professional
treachery&mdash;base, personal ingratitude and a
violation of all the ethics of their highly ethical
calling.</p>

<p>Mr. Murtha, looking at things through very
different glasses, put it on the high ground of
his duty, as a citizen and a taxpayer, to the
general health and the general morality of the
general public. It is this same difference of
opinion which makes neighbourhood quarrels,
<a name="p323" id="p323"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>323<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>lawsuits and wars between nations popular
in the most civilised climes.</p>

<p>In all essential details, the tale, when Murtha
was through with Singlebury and Singlebury
was through with Murtha, stood completed and
connected, jointed and doubt-proof. That second
evening Singlebury spent in his room,
arranging his data in their proper sequence and
mapping out in his head his introduction.
Next day, all day, he wrote his story. Just
before dusk he drew the last page out of his
typewriter and corrected it. The job was done
and it was a good job. It ran four columns
and over. It stripped that traffic grab to its
bare and grinning bones. It was loaded with
bombshells for the proposed merger and with
the shrapnel of certain criminal prosecution for
the men behind that merger, and most of all
for John W. Blake, the man behind those other
and lesser men.</p>

<p>To Singlebury, though, it was even more than
this. To him it was a good story, well written,
well balanced, happily adjusted, smartly
phrased; and on top of this, it was the most
precious jewel of a reporter’s treasure casket.
It was a cracking, smashing, earth-shaking,
exclusive&mdash;scoop, as they would have called it
out yonder on the Coast where he came from&mdash;beat,
as they would call it here in New York.</p>

<p>Personally, as per instructions, he put the
finished manuscript into the hands of Mr. Foxman,
in Mr. Foxman’s office, then stood by
<a name="p324" id="p324"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>324<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>while Mr. Foxman ran through the opening
paragraphs.</p>

<p>“Singlebury,” said Mr. Foxman, laying the
sheets down, “this looks to me like a good piece
of work. I like your beginning, anyhow. The
first ten lines ought to blow that bunch of
pirates clean out of water.” He glanced keenly
at the drooping figure of the other. “Kind of
played out, aren’t you?”</p>

<p>“A little,” confessed the reporter. “Now
that it’s over, I do feel a bit let down.”</p>

<p>“I’ll bet you do,” said Mr. Foxman. “Well,
you’d better run along to your hotel and get a
good night’s rest. Take to-morrow off too&mdash;don’t
report here until day after to-morrow;
that’ll be Friday, won’t it? All right then, I’ll
see you Friday afternoon here; I may have
something of interest to say to you then.
Meanwhile, as I told you before, keep your
mouth shut to everybody. I don’t know yet
whether I’ll want to run your story to-morrow
morning or the morning after. My information
is that Blake, through his lawyers, will
announce the completion of the merger, probably
on Friday, or possibly on Saturday. I may
decide to hold off the explosion until they come
out with their announcement. Really, that
would be the suitable moment to open fire on
’em and smash up their little stock-market
game for them.”</p>


<p class="tb"><br class="ns"
 />Dog-tired and happier than any poor dog of a
<a name="p325" id="p325"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>325<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>newspaper man has a right to be, Singlebury
went to his room and to bed. And when finally
he fell asleep he dreamed the second chapter
of that orange-blossomy dream of his.</p>

<p>Being left to himself, Mr. Foxman read Singlebury’s
copy through page by page, changing
words here and there, but on the whole enormously
pleased with it. Then he touched a
buzzer button under his desk, being minded
to call into conference the chief editorial writer
and the news editor before he put the narrative
into type. Now it happened that at this precise
moment Mr. Foxman’s own special boy
had left his post just outside Mr. Foxman’s
door to skylark with a couple of ordinary copy
boys in the corridor between the city room and
the Sunday room, and so he didn’t answer the
summons immediately. The fact was, he
didn’t hear the bell until Mr. Foxman impatiently
rang a second and a third time. Then
he came running, making up a suitable excuse
to explain his tardiness as he came. And during
that half minute of delay there leaped out
of nowhere into Mr. Foxman’s brain an idea&mdash;an
idea, horned, hoofed and hairy&mdash;which was
to alter the current of his own life and, directly
or indirectly, the lives of scores of others.</p>


<p class="tb"><br class="ns"
 />It would seem I was a trifle premature, back
yonder near the beginning of this chapter, when
I used the line: Six-thirty-four&mdash;enter the
villain.</p>

<p><a name="p326" id="p326"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>326<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span>Because, as I now realise, the villain didn’t
enter then. The villain did not enter until this
moment, more than forty-eight hours later,
entering not in the guise of a human being but
in the shape of this tufted, woolly demon of a
notion which took such sudden lodgment in
Mr. Foxman’s mind. Really, I suppose we
should blame the office boy. His being late
may have been responsible for the whole thing.</p>

<p>He poked a tow head in at the door, ready
to take a scolding.</p>

<p>“D’yer ring, sir?” he inquired meekly.</p>

<p>“Yes, three times,” said Mr. Foxman.
“Where have you been?”</p>

<p>“Right here, sir. Somethin’ you wanted,
sir?”</p>

<p>“No; I’ve changed my mind. Get out!”</p>

<p>Pleased and surprised to have escaped, the
towhead withdrew. Very deliberately Mr.
Foxman lit a cigar, leaned back in his chair,
and for a period took mental accounting of his
past, his present and his future; and all the
while he did this a decision was being forged
for him, by that busy devilish little tempter,
into shape and point and permanency.</p>

<p>In his fingers he held the means of making
himself independent&mdash;yes, even rich. Why&mdash;he
began asking himself the plaguing question
and kept on asking it&mdash;why should he go on
working his life out for twelve thousand dollars
a year when, by one safe, secret stroke, he
could make twelve times twelve thousand, or
<a name="p327" id="p327"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>327<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>very possibly more? He knew what happened
to newspaper executives who wore out in the
harness. Offhand, he could think of half a
dozen who had been as capable as he was, as
active and as zealous, and as single-purposed
in their loyalty to the sheets they served as he
was to this sheet which he served.</p>

<p>All of these men had held high editorial posts
and, in their prime, had drawn down big salaries,
as newspaper salaries go. Where were they
now, since they had grown old? He knew
where they were&mdash;mighty good and well he
knew. One trying to run a chicken farm on
Staten Island and daily demonstrating that a
man who could manage a newspaper does not
necessarily know how to manage a flock of
temperamental White Leghorn hens; one an
exchange editor, a neglected and unconsidered
figure of obscurity, a nonentity almost, and a
pensioner, practically, in the same shop whose
affairs his slackened old hands had once controlled;
one or two more of them actually
needy&mdash;out of work and out at elbows; and so
on, and so forth, through the list.</p>

<p>Well, it rested with Mr. Foxman to avert
such a finish to his own career; the instrument
fitted to combat the prospect was here in his
grasp. Temptation, whispering to him, bade
him use it&mdash;told him he would be a sorry fool
not to use it. What was that line about Opportunity’s
knocking once at every man’s door?
And what was that other line about there being
<a name="p328" id="p328"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>328<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>a tide in the affairs of men, which, taken at the
flood, leads on to fortune?</p>

<p>After all, it meant only that he break faith
with five men:&mdash;with his employer, General
Lignum, who trusted him; with his underling,
Singlebury, who had done a good job of work for
him; and with three others whom, for the sake
of convenience, he mentally grouped together&mdash;Bogardus
and Pratt and Murtha, the lawyer.
These three he eliminated from the equation in
one puff of blue cigar smoke. For they were all
three of them crooks and plotters and double
dealers, masters of the dirty trick and the dirty
device, who conspired together to serve not the
general good, but their own squalid and contemptible
ends.</p>

<p>For General Lignum he had more heed. Perhaps
I should say here that until this hour this
man, Hobart Foxman, had been an honest
man&mdash;not just reasonably honest but absolutely
honest, a man foursquare as a smokehouse.
Never before had it occurred to him to
figure up to see whether honesty really paid.
He did some brisk figuring now.</p>

<p>After all, did it pay? As a reporter, back
yonder in the old days when he, a raw cub, first
broke into this wearing, grinding newspaper
game, he had despised fakers and faking and the
petty grafting, the cheap sponging to which he
saw some reporters&mdash;not many, perhaps, but
some&mdash;descending. As an assistant sporting
editor, after his first promotion from the ranks,
<a name="p329" id="p329"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>329<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>he had been content to live upon his somewhat
meagre salary, refusing to fatten his income by
taking secret pay from prize-fight promoters
wishful of getting advertisements dressed up as
news stories into the columns of the sporting
page. As a staff correspondent, first at Albany
and then at Washington, he had walked wide
of the lobbyists who sought to corrupt and succeeded
in corrupting certain correspondents, and
by corrupting them were able sometimes to
colour the news, sometimes to suppress it.
Always the dispatches he signed had been unbiased,
fair, above the board.</p>

<p>To be sure, Foxman had played office politics
the while he went up, peg by peg. To men
above him he had been the assiduous courtier,
crooking the pregnant knee before those who
might help him onward. But, then, that was a
part of the game&mdash;office politics was. Even so,
playing it to the top of his bent, he had been on
the level. And what had being on the level
brought him? It had brought him a place of
executive authority and a salary of twelve
thousand a year. And these two things&mdash;the
place and the twelve thousand&mdash;he would continue
to have and to hold and to enjoy for just
so long as he was strong enough to fight off
ambitious younger men, climbing up from below
as he had climbed; or, worse luck, for just so
long as he continued to please the mercurial
millionaire who two years earlier, at public outcry,
had bought <i>The Clarion</i>, lock, stock and
<a name="p330" id="p330"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>330<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>barrel, with its good will and fixtures&mdash;just as a
man might buy a cow with its calf in the drover’s
pen.</p>

<p>That brought him round again to a consideration
of General Lignum. Metaphysically he
undressed the general and considered him
naked. He turned him about and looked at
him on every side. The result was not flattering
to that impressive and dignified gentleman.
Was General Lignum so deserving of consideration?
What had General Lignum ever done
in all his luxurious days to justify him to a
place in the sun? Lignum never worked for
his millions; he inherited them. When Lignum
bought <i>The Clarion</i>, then as now a losing
property, he had been actuated by the same
whim which makes a spoiled child crave the
costliest toy in the toy shop and, like that
spoiled child, he would cast it aside, unmindful
of its future, in the same hour that he tired of
his newest possession and of the cost of its
upkeep.</p>

<p>Wasn’t Lignum lavishing wads of his easy-come,
easy-go money on it now, because of his
ambition to be a United States senator? Most
certainly he was&mdash;for that and nothing else.
Barring his wealth, which was a gift to him,
and his newspaper, which was a plaything,
what qualified this dilettante to sit in the seats
of the mighty? What did Lignum know of the
toil and the sweat and the gifts spent by men,
whose names to him were merely items in a
<a name="p331" id="p331"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>331<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>pay roll, to make <i>The Clarion</i> a power in the
community and in the country? What did he
care? In the last analysis what anyhow was
this General Robert Bruce Lignum except a
bundle of pampered selfishness, wrapped up in
a membrane, inclosed in a frock coat and lidded
under a high hat? When he got that far Mr.
Foxman decided he owed Lignum nothing, as
compared with what Lignum owed him. Well,
here was a chance to collect the debt, with back
dividends and interest accrued. He would collect.
He would make himself independent of
the whims of Lignum, of the necessity of daily
labour, of the uncertainties of his position, of the
certainty of the oncoming of age when his hand
must tire and his wits grow blunted.</p>

<p>This left to be disposed of&mdash;only Singlebury.
And Singlebury, in Mr. Foxman’s mind, was
now become the least of the factors concerned.
In this, his new scheme of things that had
sprung full-grown from the loins of a great and
a sudden desire, a Singlebury more or less mattered
not a whit. In the same moment that he
decided to discard Singlebury the means of discarding
Singlebury came to him.</p>

<p>That inspiration clarified the situation tremendously,
interlocking one part of his plan
with the others. In any event the lips of Pratt,
Bogardus and Murtha were closed, and their
hands tied. By now Lignum was at least a
thousand miles out at sea. In the working out
of his scheme Foxman would be safe from
<a name="p332" id="p332"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>332<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>the meddlings and muddlings of Old Lignum.
Already he had begun to think of that gentleman
as Old Lignum instead of as General Lignum,
so fast were his mental aspects and attitudes
altering. Finally, with Singlebury out
of the way, the plot would stand up, a completed
and almost a perfect edifice.</p>

<p>However, there was one contingency to be
dared. In a way it was a risk, yet an inevitable
one. No matter what followed he must put
the exposé story into print; that absolutely was
requisite to the proper development of the plan.
For Mr. Foxman well knew the psychological
effect of the sight of cold type upon the minds of
men planning evil things. He didn’t know
John W. Blake personally, but he knew John
W. Blake’s kind, and he figured John W. Blake
as being in his essentials no different from the
run of his kind. Nor was he wrong there, as
will appear. Moreover, the risk, while necessary
to the carrying out of his present designs,
was a risk only in the light of possibilities arising
later. Being now fully committed to the venture,
he told himself he shouldn’t much care if
detection did come after the accomplishment of
his purpose. Long before that could happen,
he, having made his pile and being secure in the
possession of a fortune, would be able to laugh
in the faces of his own little world, because anyhow
he meant to move on into another circle
very soon thereafter. Yes; there was one risk
to be taken. On the instant that he arrived at
<a name="p333" id="p333"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>333<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>this point in his reasonings he set about taking
it.</p>

<p>First off, he read Singlebury’s copy through
once more, amending the wording in a few
places. He made certain accusations direct
and forcible where the reporter, in his carefulness,
had been a trifle vague. Then he drew to
him a block of copy paper and set about
heading and subheading the story. In the
days when he sat in the slot of a copy desk Mr.
Foxman had been a master hand at headlining;
with disuse his knack of hand had not grown
rusty. He built and balanced a three-column,
three-decker top caption and, to go under it,
the heavy hanging indentions and the bold cross
lines. From the body of the manuscript, also,
he copied off several assertions of a particular
emphasis and potency and marked them to go
at the top of the story in blackface, with a box
about them. This much done, he went to his
door and hailed the night city editor, sitting a
few yards away.</p>

<p>“Oh, Sloan,” he said, “send a boy upstairs
for McManus, will you?”</p>

<p>“McManus isn’t here to-night,” answered
Sloan. He got up and came over to his chief.
McManus was the make-up editor.</p>

<p>“This isn’t McManus’ night off, is it?”
asked Mr. Foxman.</p>

<p>“No, Mac’s sick,” explained Sloan; “he
was complaining last night and went home
early, and I stayed on to make up his last two
<a name="p334" id="p334"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>334<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>pages for him. A little while ago his wife telephoned
in from Bayside that he was in bed
with a high fever. She said the doctor said
it was a touch of malaria and that Mac couldn’t
possibly get back to work for a week, anyhow.”</p>

<p>“I see,” said Mr. Foxman slowly. He ran
his eye over the city room. “Whom did you
put on in his place?”</p>

<p>“Gykeman.”</p>

<p>“Gykeman, eh?” Mr. Foxman considered a
moment. This news of McManus’ indisposition
pleased him. It showed how willing was
Fate to keep on dealing him the winning cards.
But Gykeman wasn’t his choice for the task
he had in mind; that called for someone of a
less inquiring, less curious mind than Gykeman
owned. Again his eye ranged the city room.
It fell on a swollen and dissipated face, purplish
under the electric lights.</p>

<p>“I believe you’d better bring Gykeman back
downstairs,” he said, “I want him to read copy
on that Wilder poisoning case that’s going to
trial to-morrow in General Sessions. Let’s
see.” He went through the pretense of canvassing
the available material in sight. Then:</p>

<p>“Hemburg will do. Put Hemburg on make-up
until Mac is well again.”</p>

<p>“Hemburg?” The city editor’s eyebrows
arched in surprise. “I thought you didn’t
think very highly of Hemburg, Mr. Foxman.”</p>

<p>“Hemburg’s all right,” said Mr. Foxman
crisply; “it’s his personal habits I don’t fancy
<a name="p335" id="p335"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>335<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>very much. Still, with half a load on Hemburg
is capable enough&mdash;and I never saw him
with less than half a load on. He can handle
the make-up; he used to be make-up man years
ago on the old <i>Star-Ledger</i>, it seems to me. Put
him on instead of Gykeman&mdash;no, never mind;
send him in here to me. I’ll tell him myself
and give him some good advice at the same
time.”</p>

<p>“Well, just as you think best,” said Sloan,
miffed that his own selection should have been
rejected, but schooled to an unquestioning
obedience by the seemingly slack&mdash;but really
rigorous&mdash;discipline of a newspaper shop.
“I’ll send him right in.”</p>

<p>Two minutes later Hemburg was standing in
an attitude of attention alongside Mr. Foxman’s
desk, and from his chair Mr. Foxman
was looking up at him steadily.</p>

<p>“Hemburg,” he stated, “I can’t say that
I’ve been altogether pleased with you here of
late.”</p>

<p>Hemburg put up a splotched, tremulous
hand, to hide a weak mouth, and spoke in his
own defence from between his fingers.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m sorry if anything has gone wrong,
Mr. Foxman,” he began; “I <span class="nw">try&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>“I don’t mean there’s any particular complaint,”
stated Mr. Foxman, “only it struck me
you’ve been getting into a rut lately. Or that
you’ve been going stale&mdash;let’s put it that way.
On my own judgment I’ve given orders that you
<a name="p336" id="p336"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>336<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>are to go on make-up temporarily, beginning
to-night. It’s up to you to make good there.
If you do make good, when McManus comes
back I’ll look round and see if there isn’t something
better than a forty-dollar-a-week copy-reading
job for you in this office.”</p>

<p>“I’m&mdash;I’m certainly obliged to you, Mr.
Foxman,” stuttered Hemburg. “I guess maybe
I was getting logy. A fellow certainly does
get in a groove out there on that copy desk,”
he added with the instinct of the inebriate to
put the blame for his shortcomings on anything
rather than on the real cause of those shortcomings.</p>

<p>“Perhaps so,” said Mr. Foxman; “let’s see
if making a change won’t work a cure. Do you
see this?” and he put his hand on the sheaf of
Singlebury’s copy lying on his desk, under the
captions he himself had done. “Well, this may
turn out to be the biggest beat and the most
important story that we’ve put over in a year.
It’s all ready to go to the type-setting machines&mdash;I
just finished reading copy on it myself.
But if it leaks out&mdash;if a single word about this
story gets out of this building before we’re
ready to turn it loose on the street&mdash;the man
responsible for that leak is going to lose his job
no matter who or what he is. Understand?</p>

<p>“Now, then, excepting you and me and the
man who wrote it, nobody employed inside this
building knows there is such a story. I want
you to take it upstairs with you now. Don’t
<a name="p337" id="p337"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>337<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>let ’em cut it up into regular takes for the
machines. Tell the composing-room foreman&mdash;it’ll
be Riordan, I guess&mdash;that he’s to take
his two best machine operators off of whatever
they’re doing and put ’em to work setting this
story up, and nothing else. Those two men
are to keep right at it until it’s done. I want a
good, safe-mouthed man to set the head. I
want the fastest proofreader up there, whoever
that may be, to read the galley proofs, holding
copy on it himself. Impress it on Riordan to
tell the proofreader, the head setter and the two
machine men that they are not to gab to anyone
about what they’re doing. When the story
is corrected I want you to put it inside a chase
with a hold-for-release line on it, and cover it
up with print paper, sealed and pasted on, and
roll it aside. We’ve already got one hold-for-release
yarn in type upstairs; it’s a Washington
dispatch dealing with the Mexican situation.
Better put the two stories close together
somewhere out of the way. Riordan will know
where to hide them. Then you bring a set of
clean proofs of this story down here to me&mdash;to-night.
I’ll wait right here for you.</p>

<p>“I’d like to run the thing to-morrow morning,
leading with two columns on the front page
and a two-column turnover on page two. But
I can’t. There’s just one point to be cleared
up before it’ll be safe to print it. I expect to
clear up that point myself to-morrow. Then
if everything is all right I’ll let you know and
<a name="p338" id="p338"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>338<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>we’ll probably go to the bat with the story
Friday morning; that’ll be day after to-morrow.
If it should turn out that we can’t use it I want
you to dump the whole thing, head and all,
and melt up the lead and forget that such a
story ever passed through your hands. Because
if it is safe&mdash;if we have got all our facts
on straight&mdash;it’ll be a great beat. But if we
haven’t it’ll be about the most dangerous chunk
of potential libel that we could have knocking
about that composing room. Do you get the
point?”</p>

<p>Hemburg said he got it. His instructions
were unusual; but, then, from Mr. Foxman’s
words and manner, he realised that the story
must be a most unusual one too. He carried
out the injunctions that had been put upon him,
literally and painstakingly. And while so engaged
he solemnly pledged himself never again
to touch another drop of rum so long as he
lived. He had made the same promise a hundred
times before. But this time was different&mdash;this
time he meant it. He was tired of being
a hack and a drudge. This was a real opportunity
which Mr. Foxman had thrown in his
way. It opened up a vista of advancement and
betterment before him. He would be a fool
not to make the most of it, and a bigger fool
still ever to drink again.</p>

<p>Oh, but he meant it! It would be the
straight and narrow path for him hereafter; the
good old water-wagon for his, world without
<a name="p339" id="p339"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>339<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>end, amen. Noticeably more tremulous as to his
fingers and his lips, but borne up with his high
resolve, he put the clean proofs of the completed
story into Mr. Foxman’s hands about midnight,
and then hurried back upstairs to shape
the layout for the first mail edition.</p>

<p>As Mr. Foxman read the proofs through he
smiled under his moustache, and it was not a
particularly pleasant smile, either. Printer’s
ink gave to Singlebury’s masterpiece a sinister
emphasis it had lacked in the typewritten copy;
it made it more forceful and more forcible. Its
allegations stuck out from the column-wide
lines like naked lance tips. And in the top deck
of the flaring scare head the name of John W.
Blake stood forth in heavy black letters to
catch the eye and focus the attention. Mr.
Foxman rolled up the proof sheets, bestowed
them carefully in the inside breast pocket of his
coat, and shortly thereafter went home and to
bed.</p>

<p>But not to sleep. Pleasing thoughts, all
trimmed up with dollar marks, ran through his
head, chasing away drowsiness. All the same
he was up at eight o’clock that morning&mdash;two
hours ahead of his usual rising time. Mrs.
Foxman was away paying a visit to her people
up-state&mdash;another fortunate thing. He breakfasted
alone and, as he sipped his coffee, he
glanced about him with a sudden contempt for
the simple furnishings of his dining room.
Well, there was some consolation&mdash;this time
<a name="p340" id="p340"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>340<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>next year, if things went well, he wouldn’t be
slaving his life out for an unappreciative taskmaster,
and he wouldn’t be living in this cheap,
twelve-hundred-dollar-a-year flat, either. His
conscience did not trouble him; from the moment
the big notion came to him it had not.
Greed had drugged it to death practically instantaneously.</p>

<p>No lees of remorse, no dreggy and bitterish
reflections, touching upon the treachery he contemplated
and the disloyalty to which he had
committed himself, bothered him through that
busy day. In his brain was no room for such
things, but only for a high cheerfulness and
exaltation. To be sure, he was counting his
chickens before they were hatched, but the eggs
were laid, and he didn’t see how they could
possibly addle between now and the tallying
time of achieved incubation. So, with him in
this frame of mind, the day started. And it
was a busy day.</p>

<p>His first errand was to visit the safety-deposit
vaults of a bank on lower Broadway. In a box
here, in good stable securities of a total value of
about sixteen thousand dollars, he had the bulk
of his savings. He got them out and took them
upstairs, and on a demand note the president of
the bank loaned him twelve thousand dollars,
taking Mr. Foxman’s stocks and bonds as collateral.
In the bank he had as a checking account
a deposit somewhat in excess of two
thousand dollars. Lying to Mrs. Foxman’s
<a name="p341" id="p341"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>341<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>credit was the sum of exactly ten thousand
dollars, a legacy from an aunt recently dead, for
which as yet Mrs. Foxman and her husband had
found no desirable form of investment. Fortunately
he held her power of attorney. He transferred
the ten thousand from her name to his,
which, with what he had just borrowed and what
he himself had on deposit, gave him an available
working capital of a trifle above twenty-four
thousand dollars. He wrote a check payable
to bearer for the whole stake and had it certified,
and then, tucking it away in his pocket, he went
round the corner into Broad Street to call upon
John W. Blake at the Blake Bank. The supreme
moment toward which he had been advancing
was at hand.</p>

<p>As a man of multifarious and varied interests,
and all of them important, Mr. Blake was a reasonably
busy man. Before now ordinary newspaper
men had found it extremely hard to see
Mr. Blake. But Mr. Foxman was no ordinary
newspaper man; he was the managing editor of
<i>The Clarion</i>, a paper of standing and influence,
even if it didn’t happen to be a money-maker
at present. Across a marble-pillared, brass-grilled
barrier Mr. Foxman sent in his card to
Mr. Blake and, with the card, the word that
Mr. Foxman desired to see Mr. Blake upon
pressing and immediate business. He was not
kept waiting for long. An office boy turned
him over to a clerk and the clerk in turn turned
him over to a secretary, and presently, having
<a name="p342" id="p342"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>342<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>been ushered through two outer rooms, Mr.
Foxman, quite at his ease, was sitting in Mr.
Blake’s private office, while Mr. Blake read
through the galley proofs of Singlebury’s
story to which the caller had invited his attention.<!-- period invisible in original --></p>

<p>The gentleman’s face, as he read on, gave no
index to the feelings of the gentleman. Anyhow,
Mr. Blake’s face was more of a manifest
than an index; its expression summed up conclusions
rather than surmises. As a veteran
player&mdash;and a highly successful one&mdash;in the
biggest and most chancy game in the world,
Mr. Blake was fortunate in having what lesser
gamesters call a poker face. Betraying neither
surprise, chagrin nor indignation, he read the
article through to the last paragraph of the last
column. Then carefully he put the crumpled
sheets down on his big desk, leaned back in his
chair, made a wedge of his two hands by matching
finger tip to finger tip, aimed the point of
the wedge directly at Mr. Foxman, and looked
with a steadfast eye at his visitor. His visitor
looked back at him quite as steadily, and for a
moment or two nothing was said.</p>

<p>“Well, Mr. Foxman?” remarked Mr. Blake
at length. There was a mild speculation in his
inflection&mdash;nothing more.</p>

<p>“Well, Mr. Blake?” replied the other in the
same casual tone.</p>

<p>“I suppose we needn’t waste any time sparring
about,” said Mr. Blake. “I gather that
<a name="p343" id="p343"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>343<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>your idea is to publish this&mdash;this attack, in
your paper?”</p>

<p>“That, Mr. Blake, is exactly my idea, unless”&mdash;and
for just a moment Mr. Foxman
paused&mdash;“unless something should transpire to
cause me to change my mind.”</p>

<p>“I believe you told me when you came in that
at this moment you are in absolute control of
the columns and the policy of <i>The Clarion</i>?”</p>

<p>“I am&mdash;absolutely.”</p>

<p>“And might it be proper for me to ask when
you contemplate printing this article&mdash;in what
issue?” Mr. Blake was very polite, but no
more so than Mr. Foxman. Each was taking
the cue for his pose from the other.</p>

<p>“It is a perfectly proper question, Mr.
Blake,” said Mr. Foxman. “I may decide to
print it day after to-morrow morning. In the
event of certain contingencies I might print it
to-morrow morning, and again on the other
hand”&mdash;once more he spoke with deliberate
slowness&mdash;“I might see my way clear to suppressing
it altogether. It all depends, Mr.
Blake.”</p>

<p>“Did it ever occur to you that with this
warning which you have so kindly given me,
I have ample opportunity to enjoin you in the
courts from printing all or any part of this
article on to-morrow or any subsequent day?”</p>

<p>“You are at perfect liberty to try to enjoin
us, Mr. Blake. But did it ever occur to you
that such a step wouldn’t help your case in the
<a name="p344" id="p344"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>344<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>least? Go ahead and enjoin, Mr. Blake, if you
care to, and see what would happen to you in
the matter of&mdash;well, let us say, undesirable publicity.
Instead of one paper printing these
facts&mdash;for they are facts, Mr. Blake&mdash;you
would have all the papers printing them in one
shape or another.”</p>

<p>“Without arguing that point further just
now, might I be allowed to mention that I fail
to understand your motive in coming to me,
Mr. Foxman, at this time?” said the banker.</p>

<p>“Mr. Blake,” said Mr. Foxman, contemplating
the tip of his cigar, “I’ll give you two
guesses as to my motive, and your first guess
will be the correct one.”</p>

<p>“I see,” stated the other meditatively, almost
gently. Then, still with no evidences of heat
or annoyance: “Mr. Foxman, there is a reasonably
short and rather ugly word to describe
what you are driving at. Here in this part of
town we call it blackmail.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Blake,” answered the editor evenly,
“there is a much shorter and even uglier word
which describes your intentions. You will find
that word in the second&mdash;or possibly it is the
third&mdash;line of the first paragraph of the matter
you have just been reading. The word is
‘steal.’”</p>

<p>“Possibly you are right, Mr. Foxman,” said
Mr. Blake dryly. He drew the proof sheets to
him, adjusted his glasses and looked at the topmost
sheet. “Yes, you are right, Mr. Foxman&mdash;I
<a name="p345" id="p345"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>345<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>mean about the word in question. It appears
in the second line.” He shoved the proofs
aside. “It would appear you are a reasonable
man&mdash;with a business instinct. I flatter myself
that I am reasonable and I have been in business
a good many years. Now, then, since we
appear to be on the point of thoroughly understanding
each other, may I ask you another
question?”</p>

<p>“You may.”</p>

<p>“What is your price for continuing to be&mdash;ahem&mdash;reasonable?”</p>

<p>“I can state it briefly, Mr. Blake. Being
a newspaper man, I am not a wealthy man. I
have an ambition to become wealthy. I look
to you to aid me in the accomplishment of that
desire. You stand in a fair way to make a
great deal of money, though you already have a
great deal. I stand in the position not only of
being able to prevent you from making that
money, but of being able to make a great deal
of trouble for you, besides. Or, looking at the
other side of the proposition, I have the power
to permit you to go ahead with your plans.
Whether or not I exercise that power rests
entirely with you. Is that quite plain?”</p>

<p>“Very. Pray proceed, Mr. Foxman. You
were going to <span class="nw">say&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>“I was going to say that since you hope to
make a great deal of money I wish by cooperation
with you, as it were, to make for myself a sum
which I regard as ample for my present needs.”</p>

<p><a name="p346" id="p346"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>346<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span>“And by ample&mdash;you mean what?”</p>

<p>“I mean this: You are to carry me with your
brokers for ten thousand shares of the common
stock of the Pearl Street trolley line on a ten-point
margin. The account may be opened in
the name of Mr. X; I, of course, being Mr. X.
I apprehend that the party known as X will see
his way clear to closing out the account very
shortly after the formal announcement of your
plans for the East Side transit merger&mdash;certainly
within a few days. If there should be
any losses you will stand them up to and including
the ten-point margin. If there should
be any profits they go, of course, to Mr. X.
I do not anticipate that there will be any losses,
and I do anticipate that there will be some
profits. In payment for this friendly accommodation
on your part, I for my part will engage
to prevent the publication in <i>The Clarion</i>,
or elsewhere, of the statements contained in
those proofs and now standing in type in our
composing room, subject to my order to print
the story forthwith, or to withhold it, or to kill
it outright.”</p>

<p>“Anything else, Mr. Foxman?” inquired Mr.
Blake blandly.</p>

<p>“Yes, one other thing: You are to give the
necessary order now, in my presence, over the
telephone to your brokers. After that you are
to go with me to their offices to complete the
transaction and to identify me properly as the
Mr. X who is to be the owner of this particular
<a name="p347" id="p347"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>347<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>account; also you are to explain to them that
thereafter the account is subject to my orders
and mine alone. I think that will be sufficient.”</p>

<p>“It would seem, Mr. Foxman, that you do
not trust me to deal fairly with you in this
matter?”</p>

<p>“I do not have to trust you, Mr. Blake. And
so I choose not to.”</p>

<p>“Exactly. And what guaranty have I that
you will do your part?”</p>

<p>“Only my word, Mr. Blake. You will observe
now that the shoe is on the other foot.
I do not have to trust you&mdash;whereas you do
have to trust me. But if you need any guaranty
other than the thought of where my self-interest
lies in the matter I may tell you that in
addition to the stocks which you are to carry
for me I intend to invest in Pearl Street common
to the full extent of my available cash resources,
also on a ten-point margin. Here is
the best proof of that.” He hauled out his
certified check for twenty-four thousand and
some odd dollars and handed it over to Mr.
Blake.</p>

<p>Mr. Blake barely glanced at it and handed it
back, at the same time reaching for his desk
telephone.</p>

<p>“Mr. Foxman,” he said, “there may be some
pain but there is also considerable pleasure to
me in dealing with a reasonable man. I see
that your mind is made up. Why then should
we quibble? You win, Mr. Foxman&mdash;you win
<a name="p348" id="p348"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>348<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>in a walk. Whatever opinions I may entertain
as to your private character and whatever
opinions you may entertain as to my private
character, I may at least venture to congratulate
you upon your intelligence. &hellip; Oh, yes,
while I think of it, there is one other thing, Mr.
Foxman: I don’t suppose you would care to tell
me just how you came into possession of the
information contained in your article?”</p>

<p>“I would not.”</p>

<p>“I thought as much. Excuse me one moment,
if you please.” And with that Mr.
Blake, still wearing his poker face, joggled the
lever of the telephone.</p>


<p class="tb"><br class="ns"
 />What with certain negotiations, privately
conducted and satisfactorily concluded at the
brokers’, Mr. Foxman was engaged until well
on into the afternoon. This being done, he
walked across to the front of the stock exchange,
where he found a rank of taxis waiting
in line for fares when the market should close.
The long, lean months of depression had passed
and the broker gentry did not patronise the subway
these days. Daily at three o’clock, being
awearied by much shearing of woolly, fat sheep,
they rode uptown in taxicabs, utterly regardless
of mounting motor tariffs and very often
giving fat tips to their motor drivers besides.
But it is safe to say no broker, however sure he
might be of the return of national confidence,
gave a fatter tip that day than the one which
<a name="p349" id="p349"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>349<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>Mr. Foxman handed to the taxicab driver who
conveyed him to his club, in the Upper Forties.
Mr. Foxman was in a mood to be prodigal with
his small change.</p>

<p>Ordinarily he would have spent an hour or
two of the afternoon and all of the evening until
midnight or later at <i>The Clarion</i> office. But on
this particular day he didn’t go there at all.
Somehow, he felt those familiar surroundings,
wherein he had worked his way to the topmost
peg of authority, and incidentally to the confidence
of his employer and his staff, might be
to him distastefully reminiscent of former times.
Mind you, he had no shame for the thing he had
done and was doing; but instead had only a
great and splendid exhilaration. Still, he was
just as comfortable in his own mind, staying
away from that office. It could get along
without him for this once. It might as well get
used to the sensation anyway; for very shortly,
as he figured the prospect, it would have to get
along without him.</p>

<p>At his club he ate a belated luncheon and to
kill the time played billiards with two other
men, playing with his accustomed skill and with
a fine show of spirits. Billiards killed the time
for him until seven-thirty, which exactly suited
his purpose, because at seven-thirty the acting
make-up editor should be reporting for duty
down at <i>The Clarion</i> shop.</p>

<p>Mr. Foxman entered a sound-proof booth in
the little corridor that opened off the
<a name="p350" id="p350"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>350<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>main-entry hall of the club and, after calling up the
night desk and notifying Sloan he would not
come to the office at all that night, asked Sloan
to send Hemburg to the telephone.</p>

<p>“Is that you, Hemburg?” he was saying, half
a minute later. “Listen, Hemburg, this is very
important: You remember that story I turned
over to you last night? &hellip; Yes, that’s the
same one&mdash;the story I told you we would run,
provided I could establish one main point.
Well, I couldn’t establish that point&mdash;we can’t
prove up on our principal allegation. That
makes it dangerous to have the thing even
standing in type. So you go upstairs and kill
it&mdash;kill it yourself with your own hands, I
mean. I don’t want to take any chances on a
slip-up. Dump the type and have it melted
up. And, Hemburg&mdash;say nothing to anyone
about either the story itself or what has happened
to it. Understand me? &hellip; Good. And,
Hemburg, here’s another thing: You recall the
other story that I told you was being held for
release&mdash;the one on the Mexican situation? It’s
got a Washington date line over it. Well,
shove it in to-night as your leading news feature.
If we hold it much longer it’s liable to get stale&mdash;the
way things are breaking down there in
Mexico. All right; good-bye!”</p>

<p>He had rung off and hung up and was coming
out of the little booth when a fresh inspiration
came to him and he stepped back in again.
One factor remained to be eliminated&mdash;Singlebury.
<a name="p351" id="p351"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>351<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>Until that moment Mr. Foxman had
meant to sacrifice Singlebury by the simple expedient
of sending him next day on an out-of-town
assignment&mdash;over into New Jersey, or
up into New England perhaps&mdash;and then firing
him by wire, out of hand, for some alleged
reportorial crime, either of omission or of commission.
It would be easy enough to cook up
the pretext, and from his chief’s summary dismissal
of him Singlebury would have no appeal.
But suppose Singlebury came back to town, as
almost surely he would, and suppose he came
filled with a natural indignation at having been
discharged in such fashion, and suppose, about
the same time, he fell to wondering why his
great story on the Pearl Street trolley steal had
not been printed&mdash;certainly Singlebury had
sense enough to put two and two together&mdash;and
suppose on top of that he went gabbling his
suspicions about among the born gossips of
Park Row? It might be awkward.</p>

<p>These were the thoughts that jumped into
Mr. Foxman’s mind as he stepped out of the
booth, and in the same instant, while he was
stepping back in again, he had the answer for
the puzzle. Since he meant to make a burnt
offering of Singlebury, why not cook him to a
cinder and be done with it, and be done with
Singlebury too? A method of doing this was
the inspiration that came on the threshold of
the telephone booth; and when immediately
he undertook to put the trick into effect he
<a name="p352" id="p352"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>352<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>found it, in its preliminary stages, working with
that same satisfactory promise of fulfillment
that had marked all his other undertakings,
shaping into the main undertaking.</p>

<p>For example, when he called up the Godey
Arms Hotel and asked for Mr. Singlebury,
which was the thing he next did, the telephone
operator of the hotel exchange told him Mr.
Singlebury had gone out for the evening, leaving
word behind that he would be back at midnight.
Now that exactly suited Mr. Foxman. Had
Singlebury been in he had meant, on the pretext
of desiring to question him later upon some
trivial point in the big story, to have Singlebury
be at some appointed telephone rendezvous
shortly after midnight. But he knew now
with reasonable certainty where Singlebury
would be during that hour. This knowledge
simplified matters considerably; it saved him
from the bother of setting the stage so elaborately.
Without giving his name to the young
woman at the hotel switchboard he asked her to
tell Singlebury, upon his return, that a gentleman
would call him up on business of importance
some time between twelve and one o’clock.
She said she would remember the message and,
thanking her, he rang off. Well content, he
went to a theatre where a farce was playing,
sat through the performance and, going back
again to his club after the performance, had a
late supper in the grill.</p>

<p>At twelve-forty-five he finished his coffee.
<a name="p353" id="p353"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>353<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>Entering the telephone booth he got first the
Godey Arms upon the wire, and then, after a
moment, the waiting and expectant Singlebury.
In his mind all evening Mr. Foxman
had been carefully rehearsing just what he
would say and just how he would say it. Into
his voice he put exactly the right strain of hurried,
sharp anxiety as he snapped:</p>

<p>“Is that you, Singlebury?”</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s Singlebury,” came back the answer.
“That’s you, Mr. Foxman, isn’t it? I rather
imagined it would be you from <span class="nw">what&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>Mr. Foxman broke in on him.</p>

<p>“Singlebury, there’s hell to pay about that
story you wrote for me. Somebody talked&mdash;there
was a leak somewhere.”</p>

<p>“On my word of honour, Mr. Foxman,” said
the jostled Singlebury, “it wasn’t I. I obeyed
your orders to the letter <span class="nw">and&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>“I haven’t time now to try to find out who
gabbled,” snapped back Mr. Foxman; “there
are things more important to consider. About
half-past seven to-night&mdash;that was when I
first tried to reach you from down here at
the office&mdash;I got wind that Blake’s crowd had
found out about our surprise and were getting
busy. That was what I’d been afraid of,
as I told you. In the fear that they might try
to enjoin us if we held off publication any
longer I gave orders to slam the story into the
early-mail edition that went to press twenty
minutes ago. And now&mdash;now when the
<a name="p354" id="p354"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>354<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>mischief is done&mdash;when thousands of papers are
already printed&mdash;I find out that we’ve committed
criminal libel, and the worst kind of criminal libel&mdash;not
against Blake&mdash;we are safe enough there&mdash;but
against Eli Godfrey, Senior, one of the biggest
lawyers in this town. In your story you accused
him of being one of the lawyers who helped
to frame this deal. That’s what you did!”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;but&mdash;why&mdash;but”&mdash;stammered Singlebury&mdash;“but,
Mr. Foxman, Eli Godfrey, Senior,
was the man. He was&mdash;wasn’t he? All my
information <span class="nw">was&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>“It was his son, Eli Godfrey, Junior, his partner
in the firm,” declared Mr. Foxman, lying
beautifully and convincingly. “That’s who it
was. The father had nothing to do with it;
the son everything. You got the whole thing
twisted. I’ve snatched the forms back and I’m
throwing the story out of the second edition and
filling the hole with a Washington story that we
happened to have handy. So your story probably
won’t be in the edition that you will see.
But that doesn’t help much&mdash;if any. We’ve
kept the libel out of our local circulation, but
it’s already in the early mails and we can’t
catch up with it or stop it there. It’s too late
to save us or to save you.”</p>

<p>“To save me?”</p>

<p>“That’s what I said. I guess you don’t
know what the laws against criminal libel in
this state are? <i>The Clarion</i> will be sued to the
limit, that’s sure. But, as the man who wrote
<a name="p355" id="p355"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>355<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>the story, you can be sent to the penitentiary
under a criminal prosecution for criminal libel.
Do you understand&mdash;to the penitentiary? I’m
liable, too, in a way of course&mdash;anybody who
had anything to do with uttering or circulating
the false statement is liable. But you are in
worse than the rest of us.”</p>

<p>In his room at the other end of the wire panic
gripped poor Singlebury. With a feeling that
the earth had suddenly slumped away from
under his feet he clung desperately to the telephone
instrument. He had accepted this terrifically
startling disclosure unquestioningly.
Why should he question it?</p>

<p>“But if&mdash;if there was no malice&mdash;if the mistake
was made innocently and in <span class="nw">ignorance&mdash;&mdash;</span>”
he babbled.</p>

<p>In his place in the club telephone booth Mr.
Foxman, interpreting the note of fright in the
reporter’s voice, grinned to himself. Singlebury,
it was plain, didn’t know anything about
libel law. And Singlebury, it was equally
plain, was accepting without question or analysis
all that he was hearing.</p>

<p>“Lack of malice doesn’t excuse in this state!”
Mr. Foxman said, speaking with grim menace;
“you haven’t a leg to stand on. There’ll be
warrants out before breakfast time in the morning;
and by noon you’ll be in a jail cell unless
you get out of this town to-night before they
find out the name of the man who wrote this
story. Have you got any money?”</p>

<p><a name="p356" id="p356"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>356<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span>“I’ve&mdash;I’ve got some money,” answered
Singlebury, shaping the words with difficulty.
“But, Mr. Foxman, if I’m responsible I can
face the consequences. I’m willing <span class="nw">to&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>“Singlebury, I’m telling you that you haven’t
a chance. I sent you out on this story&mdash;that
was my mistake&mdash;and you got your facts
twisted&mdash;that was your mistake. Even so, I
don’t want to see you suffer. I tell you you
haven’t a show if you stay in this state ten
hours longer. You’ll wear stripes. I’m warning
you&mdash;giving you this chance to get away
while there’s still time&mdash;because you’re a young
man, a stranger in this community, with no
influence to help you outside of what <i>The
Clarion</i> could give you, and that would be
mighty little. <i>The Clarion</i> will be in bad
enough itself. The man who owns this paper
would sacrifice you in a minute to save himself
or his paper. He can’t afford to throw me to
the lions, but with you it’s different. If you
beat it he may make a scapegoat of you, but
it’ll be at long distance where it won’t hurt you
much. If you stay you’ll be a scapegoat just
the same&mdash;and you’ll serve time besides. Because
I can’t help feeling sorry for you I’m
offering you a chance by giving you this
warning.”</p>

<p>“I’ll go then&mdash;I’ll go right away, I’ll do as
you say, sir. What&mdash;what would you suggest?”</p>

<p>“If I were you I’d catch a ferry for the Jersey
<a name="p357" id="p357"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>357<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>shore before daylight&mdash;they run all night, the
ferries do. And as soon as I landed on the
Jersey shore I’d catch a train for the West or
the South or somewhere and I’d stay on it till it
stopped, no matter how far it took me&mdash;the
farther from this town the better. And for the
time being I’d change my name&mdash;that’s my
parting confidential advice to you. Good-bye.
I’ve wasted more time already than I can
spare.” And having, as he figured, chosen the
proper moment for ringing off, Mr. Foxman
accordingly rang off.</p>

<p>But he made sure of the last detail&mdash;this calculating,
foreseeing, prudent man. It was less
than six blocks from his club to Singlebury’s
hotel. He drove the distance as speedily as a
motor could carry him and, halting the taxi he
had hired in the quiet street on the opposite
side of the roadway, he, hidden in its interior,
sat waiting and watching through the cab window;
until, a little later, he saw Singlebury
issue from the doorway of the Godey Arms,
carrying a valise in his hand, saw him climb into
a hansom cab and saw him drive away, heading
westward.</p>

<p>By Mr. Foxman’s directions his own cab
trailed the cab bearing the other right to the
ferry. Not until his eyes had followed the
diminishing figure of the reporter while it vanished
into the ferry house did he give orders to
his driver to take him home to his apartment.
Seasoned and veteran nighthawk of the Tenderloin
<a name="p358" id="p358"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>358<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>that he was, the driver concerned himself
not a bit with the peculiar conduct of any passenger
of his. He did simply as he was told.
If he was paid his legal fare and a sufficient tip
besides, he could forget anything that happened
while he and his chariot were under
charter. For a sufficiently attractive bonus he
would have winked at manslaughter. That
was his code.</p>

<p>Being deposited at his home shortly before
three <span class="allsc">A.&nbsp;M.</span>, Mr. Foxman became aware of a let-down
sensation. With the strain relieved he
felt the after-effects of the strain. He was
sleepy and he was very tired; likewise very
happy. Not a slip had occurred anywhere.
Blake had been tractable and Singlebury had
been credulous, and Hemburg, of course, had
been obedient. The story would never see daylight,
the big merger would be announced according
to schedule, and Pearl Street common
would go kiting up thirty or forty, or maybe
fifty points. And he was loaded to the gunwales
with the stock&mdash;bought at nineteen and
three-quarters. For obvious reasons Blake
would keep his mouth shut; for other reasons,
just as good, Pratt, Bogardus and Murtha
would keep their mouths closed too. They
might, in private, indulge in a spell of wonderment,
but they would do their wondering where
no outsider overheard it&mdash;that was sure.</p>

<p>Hemburg, who travelled in an alcoholic maze
anyhow, doing as he was told and asking no
<a name="p359" id="p359"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>359<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>questions, would not be apt to talk. Why
should he talk? Moreover, upon some plausible
excuse Mr. Foxman meant that Hemburg
and <i>The Clarion</i> should shortly part company.
General Lignum, happily, would be absent
from the country for at least a month and possibly
for six weeks. If by the time he returned
he hadn’t forgotten all about the East Side
traction business it would be easy enough to
make him forget about it. Pulling wool over
Lignum’s eyes should be the easiest of jobs.
Lignum would be having his political ambitions
to think about; one beat more or less would
mean nothing to Lignum, who had no journalistic
instincts or training anyway.</p>

<p>As for Singlebury&mdash;well, the coup by which
that young man had been disposed of was the
smartest trick of them all, so Mr. Foxman told
himself. Every avenue leading to possible
detection was closed up, blocked off and sealed
shut. In any event he, Hobart Foxman, was
bound to make his pile; it was highly probable
that there would be no price to pay in the subsequent
loss of Hobart Foxman’s professional
reputation. He had been prepared, if need be,
to surrender his good name in exchange for a
fortune, but if he might have both&mdash;the name
and the fortune&mdash;so much the better for Hobart
Foxman.</p>

<p>He hummed a cheerful little tune as he undressed
himself and got into bed. There he
slept like a dead man until the long hand of the
<a name="p360" id="p360"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>360<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>clock had circled the clock face a good many
times.</p>

<p>It was getting along toward eleven o’clock in
the forenoon and the summer sunlight, slipping
through chinks in the curtains at the windows
of his bedroom, had patterned the bed covers
with yellow stencillings<!-- original reads 'stencilings' --> when Mr. Foxman
awoke. For a spell he yawned and stretched.
Then, in his slippers and his dressing gown, he
went through the hall to the dining room to tell
the maid out in the kitchen she might serve him
his breakfast. According to the rule of the
household copies of all the morning papers were
lying at his place on the dining table. There
was quite a sizable heap of them. <i>The Clarion</i>,
folded across, made the topmost layer of the
pile. Governed more by a habit of long
standing than by any active desire to see
what it contained, he picked it up and opened
it out.</p>


<p class="tb"><br class="ns"
 />Out in the kitchen the maid heard some one
in the dining room give a queer strangled cry.
She came running. Her master stood in the
middle of the floor with an opened newspaper
in his two shaking hands. He didn’t seem to
see her, didn’t seem to hear the astonished bleat
which promptly she uttered; but above the rim
of the printed sheet she saw his face. She saw
it in the first instant of entering, and for sundry
succeeding seconds saw nothing else. It
was a face as white as so much chalk, and set
<a name="p361" id="p361"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>361<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>in it a pair of eyes that popped from their
sockets and glared like two shiny, white-ringed,
agate marbles, and at its lower end a jaw that
lolled down until it threatened self-dislocation.
The maid figured Mr. Foxman had been rendered
suddenly and seriously unwell by something
shocking he had found in the paper.</p>

<p>Therein she was right; it was a true diagnosis
if ever there was one. Mr. Foxman had
been suddenly and sorely stricken in the midst
of health and contentment; Mr. Foxman was
now seriously unwell, both physically and as to
the state of his nervous system.</p>

<p>Indeed the gentleman was in even more deplorable
case than the foregoing words would
indicate. Mr. Foxman was the engineer who
is hoisted by his own petard. He was the
hunter who falls into the pitfall he himself has
digged, who is impaled on the stake he himself
has planted. He was the hangman who chokes
in the noose he wove for other victims. In
short, Mr. Foxman was whatever best describes,
by simile and comparison, the creature
which unexpectedly is wrecked and ruined by
contrivances of its own devisement.</p>

<p>At the top of the first page of <i>The Clarion</i>,
smeared across three columns in letters which,
to Mr. Foxman’s petrified gaze, seemed cubits
high, ran a certain well-remembered scare head,
and under that, in two-column measure, a box
of black-faced type, and under that, with its
accusations bristling out from the body matter
<a name="p362" id="p362"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>362<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>like naked lance tips, followed the story which
told of the proposed Pearl Street trolley grab
and the proposed East Side merger steal.</p>

<p>All of it was there, every word of it, from
the crackling first paragraph to the stinging
wasp tail of the last sentence!</p>

<p>The telephone has played a considerable part
in this recital. It is to play still one more part
and then we are done with telephones.</p>

<p>Mr. Foxman regained the faculty of consecutive
thought&mdash;presently he did. He ran to the
telephone, and after a little time during which
he wildly blasphemed at the delay he secured
connection with the office of the firm of brokers
who carried the account of Mr.&nbsp;X.</p>

<p>It was too late to save anything from the
wreckage; the hour for salvaging had gone by.
A clerk’s voice, over the wire, conveyed back
the melancholy tidings. A bomb had burst in
Wall Street that morning. The East Side
merger scheme had been blown into smithereens
by a sensational story appearing in <i>The Clarion</i>,
and the fragments still were falling in a clattering
shower on the floor of the stock exchange.
As for Pearl Street trolley common, that had
gone clear through to the basement. The last
quotation on this forsaken stock had been seven
and a half asked, and nothing at all offered.</p>

<p>The account of Mr. X, therefore, was an account
no longer; it was off the books. Mr.
X’s ten-point margin having been exhausted,
Mr. X had been closed out, and to all intents
<a name="p363" id="p363"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>363<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>and purposes neither he nor his account any
longer existed.</p>

<p>Mr. Foxman’s indisposition increased in the intensity
of its visible symptoms until the alarmed
maid, standing helplessly by, decided that Mr.
Foxman was about to have a stroke of some
sort. As a matter of fact he had already had
it&mdash;two strokes really, both of them severe ones.</p>


<p class="tb"><br class="ns"
 />We go back a little now&mdash;to the evening before.
We go back to the alcoholic Hemburg,
trying to make good in his <i>ad-interim</i> eminence
as acting make-up editor and, in pursuance of
this ambition, riding for the time being upon
the water wagon, with every personal intention
of continuing so to ride during all time to come.</p>

<p>When he came on duty shortly after seven
o’clock every famished, tortured fibre in him
was calling out for whiskey. His thirst was
riding him like an Old Man of the Seas. He
sweated cold drops in his misery and, to bolster
his resolution, called up every shred of moral
strength that remained to him. Inside him a
weakened will fought with an outraged appetite,
and his jangled nerves bore the stress of this
struggle between determination and a frightful
craving.</p>

<p>In this state then, with his brain cells divided
in their allegiance to him and his rebellious
body in a tremor of torment, he was called
upon very soon after his arrival at the office to
carry out an important commission for the
<a name="p364" id="p364"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>364<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>man who had bestowed upon him his temporary
promotion. Taking the command over the
wire, he hurried upstairs to execute it.</p>

<p>Had he been comparatively drunk it is certain
that Hemburg would have made no slip;
automatically his fuddled mind would have
governed his hand to mechanical obedience of
the direction. But being comparatively sober&mdash;as
sober as nearly twenty-four hours of abstinence
could make him&mdash;poor Hemburg was
in a swirl of mental confusion. At that, out-mastered
as he was, he made only one mistake.</p>

<p>There were two stories lying in type, side by
side, on the stone. One of them was to be
played up in the leading position in the make-up.
The other was to be dumped in the hell-box.
That was the order, plain enough in his
own mind. So one of them he dumped, and the
other one he put in the forms to be printed.</p>

<p>The mistake he made was this: He dumped
the wrong one and he ran the wrong one. He
dumped the long Washington dispatch into a
heap of metal linotype strips, fit only to be
melted back again into leaden bars, and he ran
the Singlebury masterpiece. That’s what Hemburg
did&mdash;that’s all.</p>


<p class="tb"><br class="ns"
 />Well then, these things resulted: Mrs. Foxman
lost her ten-thousand-dollar legacy and
never thereafter forgave her husband for frittering
away the inheritance in what she deemed
to have been a mad fit of witless speculation.
<a name="p365" id="p365"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>365<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>Even though his money had gone with hers she
never forgave him.</p>

<p>Mr. Foxman, having sold his birthright of
probity and honour and self-respect for as bitter
and disappointing a mess of pottage as ever
mortal man had to swallow, nevertheless went
undetected in his crookedness and continued
to hold his job as managing editor of <i>The
Clarion</i>.</p>

<p>General Robert Bruce Lignum, a perfectly
innocent and well-meaning victim, was decisively
beaten in his race for the United States
senatorship. Mr. Blake saw to that personally&mdash;Mr.
John W. Blake, who figured that in some
way he had been double-crossed and who, having
in silence nursed his grudge to keep it warm,
presently took his revenge upon Foxman’s
employer, since he saw no way, in view of
everything, of hurting Foxman without further
exposing himself. Also, to save himself and his
associates from the possibility of travelling to
state’s prison, Mr. Blake found it incumbent
upon him to use some small part of his tainted
fortune in corrupting a district attorney, who
up until then had been an honourable man with
a future before him of honourable preferment
in the public service. So, though there were
indictments in response to public clamour, there
were no prosecutions, and the guilty ones went
unwhipped of justice. And after a while, when
the popular indignation engendered by <i>The
Clarion’s</i> disclosure had entirely abated, and
<a name="p366" id="p366"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>366<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>the story was an old story, and the law’s convenient
delays had been sufficiently invoked,
and a considerable assortment of greedy palms
at Albany and elsewhere had been crossed with
dirty dollars, the East Side merger, in a different
form and with a different set of dummy
directors behind it, was successfully put through,
substantially as per former programme. But
by that time the original holders of Pearl Street
trolley stocks had all been frozen out and had
nothing to show for their pains and their money,
except heart pangs and an empty bag to hold.</p>

<p>Bogardus, the lobbyist, and old Pratt, the
class leader, and Lawyer Murtha, the two-faced&mdash;not
one of whom, judged by the common
standards of honest folk, had been actuated
by clean motives&mdash;enjoyed their little
laugh at Blake’s passing discomfiture, but afterward,
as I recall, they patched up their quarrels
with him and each, in his own special field of
endeavour, basked once more in the golden sunshine
of their patron’s favour, waxing fat on the
crumbs which dropped from the greater man’s
table.</p>

<p>Hemburg’s reward for striving, however
feebly, to cure himself of the curse of liquor
was that promptly he lost his place on <i>The
Clarion’s</i> staff&mdash;Mr. Foxman personally attended
to that detail&mdash;and because of his habits
could not get a job on any other paper and
became a borrower of quarters along Park
Row.</p>

<p><a name="p367" id="p367"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>367<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span>Singlebury, who did a good reporter’s job and
wrote a great story, was never to have the small
consolation of knowing that after all he had not
committed criminal libel, nor that he had not
got his names or his facts twisted, nor even
that his story did appear in <i>The Clarion</i>.
Without stopping long enough even to buy a
copy of the paper, he ran away, a fugitive, dreading
the fear of arrest that had been conjured up
in another’s imagination and craftily grafted
upon his beguiled intelligence. And he never
stopped running, either, until he was in Denver,
Colorado, where he had to make a fresh start
all over again. While he was making it the girl
in San Jose<!-- original reads 'José'; this spelling was not adopted until 1979 -->, California, got tired of waiting for
him and broke off the engagement and married
someone else.</p>

<p>What is the moral of it all?</p>

 </span>CHAPTER IX<br
 /><span class="so">PERSONA AU GRATIN</span></h2>


<p class="newchap"><span class="dropcap ml6">To every</span> town, whether great or ungreat,
appertain and do therefore belong
certain individualistic beings. In
the big town they are more or less lost,
perhaps. In the smaller town they are readily
to be found and as readily to be recognised.
There is, for example, the man who, be the
weather what it may and frequently is, never
wears underwear, yet continues ever to enjoy
health so robust as to constitute him, especially
in winter time, a living reproach to all his fleece-lined
fellow citizens. There is the man who
hangs round somebody’s livery stable, being
without other visible means of support, and
makes a specialty of diagnosing the diseases of
the horse and trimming up fox terrier pups, as
regards their ears and tails. Among the neighbouring
youth, who yield him a fearsome veneration,
a belief exists to the effect that he never
removes the tails with an edged tool but just
takes and bites them off. There is the man
<a name="p369" id="p369"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>369<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>who, because his mother or his wife or his sister
takes in sewing, has a good deal of spare time
on his hands and devotes it to carving with
an ordinary pocketknife&mdash;he’ll show you the
knife&mdash;a four-foot chain, complete with solid
links and practical swivel ornaments, out of a
single block of soft pine, often achieving the even
more miraculous accomplishment of creating a
full-rigged ship inside of a narrow-mouthed
bottle.</p>

<p>There is the man who goes about publicly
vainglorious of his ownership of the finest gold-embossed
shaving mug in the leading barbershop.
There is the man&mdash;his name is apt to be
A. J. Abbott or else August Ackerman&mdash;who
invariably refers to himself as the first citizen
of the place, and then, to make good his joke,
shows the stranger where in the city directory
he, like Abou ben Adhem&mdash;who, since I come
to think about it, was similarly gifted in the
matter of initials&mdash;leads all the rest. There is
the town drunkard, the town profligate, the
town beau, the town comedian. And finally,
but by no means least, there is the man who
knows baseball from A, which is Chadwick, to
Z, which is Weeghman. These others&mdash;the
champion whittler, the dog-biter, and the whole
list of them&mdash;are what you might call perennials,
but he is a hardy annual, blossoming forth
in the spring when the season opens and His
Honour, the Mayor, throws out the first ball, attaining
to full-petalled effulgence along toward
<a name="p370" id="p370"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>370<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>midsummer, as the fight for the flag narrows,
growing fluffy in the pod at the seedtime of the
World’s Series in October, and through the long
winter hibernating beneath a rich mulch of
Spalding’s<!-- original reads "Spaulding's" --> guides and sporting annuals.</p>


<p class="tb"><br class="ns"
 />The thriving city of Anneburg, situate some
distance south of Mason and Dixon’s Line at the
point where the Tobacco Belt and the Cotton
Belt, fusing imperceptibly together, mingle the
nitrogenous weed and the bolled staple in the
same patchwork strip of fertile loam lands, was
large enough to enjoy a Carnegie library, a
municipal graft scandal, and a reunion of the
Confederate Veterans’ Association about once
in so often, and small enough to have and to
hold&mdash;and to value&mdash;at least one characteristic
example of each of the types just enumerated.
But especially did it excel in its exclusive possession
of J. Henry Birdseye.</p>

<p>This Mr. Birdseye, be it said, was hardly less
widely known than a certain former governor
of the state, who as the leading citizen of Anneburg
took a distinguished part in all civic and
communal movements. Yet the man was not
wealthy or eloquent; neither was he learned in
the law nor gifted with the pen. His gainful
pursuit was that of being a commercial traveller.
His business of livelihood was to sell Good Old
Mother Menifee’s Infallible Chill Cure through
nine adjacent counties of the midcontinental
malaria zone. But his principal profession was
<a name="p371" id="p371"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>371<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>the profession of baseball. In his mind G. O. P.
stood for Grand Occidental Pastime, and he
always thought of it as spelled with capital letters.
He knew the national game as a mother
knows the colour of her first-born’s eyes. He
yearned for it in the off-season interim as a
drunkard for his bottle. Offhand he could tell
you the exact weight of the bat wielded by Ed
Delehanty in 1899 when Ed hit 408; or what
Big Dan Brouthers’ average was in Big Dan’s
best year; or where Cap. Anson was born and
how he first broke into fast company, and all
the lesser circumstances connected with that
paramount event. His was the signature that
headed the subscription list which each February
secured for Anneburg a membership franchise
in a Class C League, and he the sincerest
mourner when the circuit uniformly blew up with
a low, penniless thud toward the Fourth of July.</p>

<p>He glanced at the headlines of the various
metropolitan papers for which he subscribed;
that was because, as a patriotic and public-spirited
American, he deemed it to be his duty
to keep abreast of war, crimes, markets, politics,
and the other live issues of the day; but what
he really read was the sporting department,
reading it from the vignette of its chief editor,
displayed in the upper left-hand corner, to the
sweepings of minute diamond dust accumulated
in the lower right-hand corner.</p>

<p>In short, J. Henry Birdseye was a fan in all
that the word implies. In a grist mill, now, a
<a name="p372" id="p372"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>372<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>fan means something which winnows out the
chaff from the grain. In the Orient a fan
means a plane-surface of coloured paper, bearing
a picture of a snow-capped mountain, and
having also a bamboo handle, and a tendency to
come unravelled round the edges. But when
anywhere in these United States you speak of a
fan, be you a Harlem cliff-swallow or a Bangtown
jay, you mean such a one as J. Henry
Birdseye. You know him, I know him, everybody
knows him. So much being conceded, we
get down to our knitting.</p>

<p>Springtime had come: ’twas early April. The
robin, which is a harbinger in the North and a
potpie in the South, had winged his way from
Gulfport, Mississippi, to Central Park, New
York, and, stepping stiffly on his frost-bitten
toes, was regretting he had been in such a hurry
about it. Palm Beach being through and Newport
not yet begun, the idle rich were disconsolately
reflecting that for them there was nowhere
to go except home. That Anglophobiac
of the feathered kingdom, the English
snipe, bid a reluctant farewell to the Old Southern
angleworms whose hospitality he had enjoyed
all winter, and headed for Upper Quebec,
intent now on family duties. And one morning
Mr. Birdseye picked up the Anneburg <i>Press
Intelligencer</i>, and read that on their homebound
journey from the spring training camp the
Moguls, league champions four times hand-running
and World’s Champions every once in a
<a name="p373" id="p373"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>373<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>while, were by special arrangement to stop off
for half a day in Anneburg and play an exhibition
game with the Anneburg team of the
K-A-T League.</p>

<p>Nor was it the second-string outfit of the
Moguls that would come. That band of callow
and diffident rookies would travel north
over another route, its members earning their
keep by playing match games as they went.
No, Anneburg, favoured among the haunts of
men, was to be honoured with the actual presence
of the regulars, peerlessly captained by
that short and wily premier of all baseball premiers,
so young in years yet so old in wisdom,
Swifty Megrue; and bearing with him in its
train such deathless fixtures of the Temple of
Fame as Long Leaf Pinderson, the Greatest
Living Pitcher, he who, though barely out of
his teens, already had made spitball a cherished
household word in every American home; Magnus,
that noble Indian, catcher by trade, a red
chieftain in his own right; Gigs McGuire,
mightiest among keystone bagsmen and worshipped
the hemisphere over as the most eminent
and at the same time the most cultured
umpire-baiter a dazzled planet ever beheld;
Flying Jenny Schuster, batsman extraordinary,
likewise base-stealer without a peer; Albino
Magoon, the Circassian Beauty of the outfield,
especially to be loved and revered because a
product of the Sunny Southland; Sauer and
Krautman, better known as the Dutch Lunch
<a name="p374" id="p374"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>374<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>battery; little Lew Hull, who could play any
position between sungarden and homeplate;
Salmon, a veritable walloping window-blind
with the stick; Jordan, who pitched on occasion,
employing a gifted southpaw exclusively
therefor; Rube Gracey; Streaky Flynn, always
there with the old noodle and fast enough
on his feet to be sure of a fixed assignment on
almost any other team, but carried in this unparalleled
aggregation of stars as a utility
player; Andrew Jackson Harkness; Canuck
LaFarge, and others yet besides. These mastodons
among men would flash across the palpitant
Anneburg horizon like a troupe of companion
comets, would tarry just long enough to
mop up the porous soil of Bragg County with
the best defensive the K-A-T had to offer, and
then at eventide would resume their journey to
where, on the vast home grounds, new glories
and fresh triumphs awaited them.</p>

<p>No such honour had ever come to Anneburg
before; and as Mr. Birdseye, with quickened
pulse, read and then reread the delectable tidings,
forgetting all else of lesser import which
the <i>Press Intelligencer</i> might contain, a splendid
inspiration sprang full-grown into his brain,
and in that moment he resolved that her, Anneburg’s,
honour should be his, J. Henry Birdseye’s,
opportunity. Opportunity, despite a
current impression, does not knock once at
every man’s door. Belief in the proverb to that
effect has spelled many a man’s undoing. He
<a name="p375" id="p375"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>375<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>has besat him indoors awaiting the sound of her
knuckles upon the panels when he should have
been ranging afield with his eye peeled. As a
seasoned travelling man Mr. Birdseye knew
opportunity for what she is&mdash;a coy bird and
hard to find&mdash;and knew that to get her you
must go gunning for her. But he figured he
had the proper ammunition in stock to bring
down the quarry this time&mdash;the suitable salt to
put on her tail. Of that also he felt most
certain-sure.</p>

<p>The resolution took definite form and hardened.
Details, ways and means, probable contingencies
and possible emergencies&mdash;all these
had been mapped and platted upon the blueprints
of the thinker’s mind before he laid aside
the paper. To but one man&mdash;and he only under
the pledge of a secrecy almost Masonic in
its power to bind&mdash;did Mr. Birdseye confide the
completed plan of his campaign. That man
was a neighbour of the Birdseyes, a Mr. Fluellen,
more commonly known among friends as
Pink Egg Fluellen. The gentleman did not
owe his rather startling titular adornment to
any idiosyncrasy of complexion or of physical
aspect. He went through life an animate sacrifice
to a mother’s pride. Because in her veins
coursed the blood of two old South Carolina
families, the Pinckneys and the Eggners, the
misguided woman had seen fit to have the child
christened Pinckney Eggner. Under the very
lip of the baptismal font the nickname then was
<a name="p376" id="p376"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>376<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>born, and through all the days of his fleshy embodiment
it walked with him. As a boy, boy-like,
he had fought against it; as a man, chastened
by the experience of maturity, he had
ceased to rebel. Now, as the head of a family,
he heard it without flinching.</p>

<p>On his way downtown after breakfast, Mr.
Birdseye met Mr. Fluellen coming out of his
gate bound in the same direction. As they
walked along together Mr. Birdseye told Mr.
Fluellen all, first, though, exacting from him a
promise which really was in the nature of a
solemn oath.</p>

<p>“You see, Pink Egg,” amplified Mr. Birdseye
when the glittering main fact of his ambition
had been revealed, “it’ll be like this: The
Moguls get in here over the O. &amp; Y.&nbsp;V. at
twelve-forty-five that day. Coming from the
West, that means they hit Barstow Junction at
eleven-twenty and lay over there nine minutes
for the northbound connection. Well, I’m
making Delhi the day before&mdash;seeing my trade
there. I drive over to the junction that evening
from Delhi&mdash;it’s only nine miles by buggy&mdash;stay
all night at the hotel, and when the train
with the team gets in next morning, who climbs
aboard her? Nobody but just little old me.”</p>

<p>“But won’t there be a delegation from here
waiting at Barstow to meet ’em and ride in with
’em?”</p>

<p>Mr. Birdseye was wise in the lore of local time
cards. He shook his head.</p>

<p><a name="p377" id="p377"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>377<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span>“Not a chance, Pinkie, not a chance. The
only way to get out to Barstow from here that
morning would be to get up at four o’clock and
catch the early freight. No, sir, the crowd
here won’t see the boys until we all come piling
off at the union depot at twelve-forty-five. By
that time I’ll be calling all those Moguls by
their first names. Give me an hour; that’s all
I ask&mdash;just an hour on the same train together
with ’em. You know me, and from reading in
the papers about ’em, you know about what
kind of fellows those Moguls are. Say, Pink
Egg, can’t you just close your eyes and see the
look on Nick Cornwall’s face when he and all
the rest see me stepping down off that train
along with Swifty Megrue and old Long Leaf
and the Indian, and all the outfit? I owe Nick
Cornwall one anyway. You remember how
shirty he got with me last year when I went to
him and told him if he’d switch Gillam from
short to third and put Husk Blynn second in the
batting order instead of fifth, that he’d improve
the strength of the team forty per cent.
If he’d only a-done that, we’d have been in the
money sure. But did he do it? He did not.
He told me there was only one manager getting
paid to run the club, and so far as he knew he
was him. Manager? Huh! Look where we
finished&mdash;or would have finished if the league
had lasted out the season. Eight teams, and us
in eighth place, fighting hard not to be in
ninth.”</p>

<p><a name="p378" id="p378"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>378<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span>“Suppose, though, J. Henry, there just happens
to be somebody else from Anneburg on the
twelve-forty-five?”</p>

<p>Perhaps it was a tiny spark of envy in Mr.
Fluellen’s heart which inspired him to raise this
second doubt against the certainty of his friend’s
coup.</p>

<p>“I should worry if there is!” said Mr. Birdseye.
“Who else is there in this town that can
talk their own language with those boys like I
can? I’ll bet you they’re so blamed sick and
tired of talking with ignorant, uneducated people
that don’t know a thing about baseball,
they’ll jump at a chance to associate with a man
that’s really on to every angle of the game&mdash;inside
ball and averages and standings and all
that. Human nature is just the same in a
twenty-thousand-a-year big leaguer as it is in
anybody else, if you know how to go at him.
And if I didn’t know human nature from the
ground up, would I be where I am as a travelling
salesman? Answer me that.”</p>

<p>“I guess you’re right, J. Henry,” agreed Mr.
Fluellen. “Gee, I wish I could be along with
you,” he added wistfully.</p>

<p>Mr. Birdseye shook his head in earnest discount
of any such vain cravings upon Mr.
Fluellen’s part. If there had been the remotest
prospect of having Mr. Fluellen for a companion
to share in this glory, he wouldn’t have told
anything about it to Mr. Fluellen in the first
place.</p>

<p><a name="p379" id="p379"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>379<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span>“Anyhow, I reckon my wife wouldn’t hear
to it,” said Mr. Fluellen hopelessly. “She’s
funny that way.”</p>

<p>“No, it wouldn’t do for you to be along
either, Pink Egg,” said Mr. Birdseye compassionately
but with all firmness. “You don’t
know the real science of baseball the same as I
do. They wouldn’t care to talk to anybody
that was even the least bit off on the fine points.
I was just thinking&mdash;I’ll be able to give ’em
some tips about how to size up the situation
here&mdash;not that they need it particularly.”</p>

<p>“J. Henry, you wouldn’t tip ’em off to the
weak spots in the Anneburg team?” Loyalty
to local ideals sharpened Mr. Fluellen’s voice
with anxiety.</p>

<p>“Certainly not, Pink Egg, certainly not,”
reassured Mr. Birdseye. “What do you think
I am? Not that they need to be told anything.
They’ll wipe up the ground with our bunch of
morning glories anyway&mdash;best we can hope for
is that we don’t get skunked and that the score
is kind of low. But I’ll certainly put ’em wise
to that soft place back of centre field, where the
grass is high. That’s only true sportsmanship,
that’s only fair.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” assented Mr. Fluellen, “I reckon
that’s no more than fair. Well, as I said before,
J. Henry, I certainly wish I was going to be with
you.”</p>


<p class="tb"><br class="ns"
 />The great day came and was auspiciously
<a name="p380" id="p380"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>380<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>sunshiny from its dawning onward. Contrary
to the custom of trains in certain interior sections
of our common country, the train upon
which so much depended slid into Barstow Junction
at eleven-twenty, exactly on time. On the
platform of the little box station, awaiting it,
stood our Mr. Birdseye, impatiently enduring
the company of a combination agent-telegrapher-ticketseller,
who wore pink sleeve-garters
with rosettes on them and a watch charm
carved from a peach kernel to represent a monkey
with its tail curved over its back.</p>

<p>Mr. Birdseye was costumed in a fashion befitting
the spirit of the hour, as he sensed it. The
main item of his attire was a new light-gray
business suit, but lightening touches of a semi-sporting
character were provided by such further
adornments as a white Fedora hat with a
wide black band, a soft collar held down trimly
with a gold pin fashioned like a little riding-crop,
and low tan shoes with elaborated gunwalelike
extensions of the soles, showing heavy stitching.
The finger tips of a pair of buckskin gloves, protruding
from a breast pocket of his coat, suggested
two-thirds of a dozen of small but well-ripened
plantains. His visible jewelry included
dog’s-head cuff buttons and a fob strap
of plaited leather with a heavy silver harness
buckle setting off its pendant end.</p>

<p>Looking the general effect over from time to
time during that dragging forenoon, he had each
separate time felt himself to be habited in
<a name="p381" id="p381"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>381<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>accordance with the best taste and the best judgment,
considering the nature of the occasion
and the rôle he meant to play. An added fillip
to his anticipations was afforded by the consciousness
that no rival would divide the coming
triumph with him. Anneburg had forty
thousand inhabitants, including whites&mdash;that
is, forty thousand by the United States census
reports; seventy-five thousand by patriotic
local estimates. By sight or by name Mr.
Birdseye knew most of the whites and many of
the blacks, browns and yellows. At the hotel
no Anneburgian name was registered, saving
and excepting his own; in the little knot gathered
on the platform no familiar Anneburg
shape now disclosed itself. He was alone and
all was well.</p>

<p>The locomotive rolled in and gently halted,
as though to avoid jostling its precious freightage
of talent. Behind it, tailing along up the
track, stretched two day coaches and sundry
Pullmans. From these last dropped down
dark-faced figures, white-clad in short jackets,
and they placed boxes below every alternate
set of car steps. The train conductor dismounted.
Carrying a small handbag, Mr.
Birdseye approached and hailed him.</p>

<p>“Hello, Cap,” he said, “have a smoke.”</p>

<p>“Thanks.” The conductor deposited the
cigar with tender care in the crown of his uniform
cap. “Smoke it later on, if you don’t
mind. Nice weather.”</p>

<p><a name="p382" id="p382"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>382<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span>“Which car are the boys on?” asked Mr.
Birdseye.</p>

<p>“Boys&mdash;which boys?”</p>

<p>“Why, the boys that are going to play Anneburg,
of course.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that bunch? Back yonder.” He
flirted a thumb over his shoulder toward the tail
of his vestibuled convoy. If the conductor
meant to say more he lost the chance through
his own slowness. Already Mr. Birdseye was
hurrying up the cindered stretch beyond the
platform.</p>

<p>At the portals of the rearmost Pullman but
one a porter interposed himself.</p>

<p>“Private sleeper, cap’n,” he warned.</p>

<p>“That’ll be all right,” stated Mr. Birdseye.
“That’s the one I’m looking for&mdash;came out from
Anneburg especially to meet the boys and ride
in with ’em.” He proffered a small cardboard
slip and with it a large round coin. “Take
the Pullman fare out of that and keep the
change.”</p>

<p>“A’ right, suh, boss&mdash;an’ much obliged.”
The porter pouched dollar and ticket with one
hand and with the other saluted profoundly.
He aided the generous white gentleman to
mount the steps.</p>

<p>Within the door of the coach, at the mouth
of its narrow end passage, Mr. Birdseye halted
to take swift inventory of its interior. It was a
sleeper of the pattern familiar to all who travel
much and widely; it looked its part and smelled
<a name="p383" id="p383"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>383<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>it, giving off the inevitable torrid aromas of
warm plush and heat-softened shellac. It contained
fifteen or eighteen occupants scattered
through its length, some sitting singly, some
paired off and, in one group, four together, playing
cards&mdash;all young or youngish men, all
smartly dressed, all live-looking. At first
glance Mr. Birdseye told himself he was in the
right car. At second glance he told himself he
was not so absolutely sure. For one thing, the
persons here revealed seemed so quiet, so sedate;
there was no skylarking; no quips flying
back and forth; no persiflage filtering out of the
open windows. Still, for one initiated, it should
be an easy task to make sure, and very sure at
that.</p>

<p>Almost in arm-reach of him two of the passengers
faced each other from opposite seats
with a checkerboard upon their knees. The one
who had his back to Mr. Birdseye, a tall, light-haired
person, kept his head bent in deep study
of the problem of the next move. His opponent
looked up. Barring the cut and colour of
his costume he might have passed, with his
smooth, rosy cheek and his round, blue Irish
orb, for a Christian Brother. Full well did Mr.
Birdseye know that Gigs McGuire, foremost of
all second-basemen, had studied for the priesthood
before he abandoned the seminary for the
stadium. Indeed, he knew all about Gigs
McGuire that the leading chroniclers of baseball
had ever written for publication. He advanced
<a name="p384" id="p384"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>384<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>half a pace, his right arm extended, a greeting
forming on his lips.</p>

<p>The ensuing conduct of the blue-eyed man
was peculiar, not to say disconcerting. He
stared at Mr. Birdseye for the brief part of a
brief second. Then he twisted his head over
his shoulder, and, without addressing anyone in
particular, rapidly uttered the word “Cheese!”
thrice in a tone of seeming impatience. And
then he picked up a red disk and with it
jumped a black one. Mr. Birdseye felt constrained
to step along.</p>

<p>Across the aisle diagonally were the four who
played at cards. It was to be seen that bridge
was the game occupying them. And bridge,
properly played, is an absorbing pursuit, requiring
concentration and silence. None of the
quartet bestowed so much as a sidelong look
upon Mr. Birdseye as Mr. Birdseye, slowly advancing
toward the middle of the car, passed
them by.</p>

<p>Thus progressing, he came close to one who
spraddled in solitary comfort over two seats.
This one was interred nose-deep in a book.</p>

<p>“Hello,” said Mr. Birdseye tentatively, almost
timidly, for increasing doubt assailed him.</p>

<p>“’Lo,” answered the reader in a chill monosyllable
without lifting his face from his book.
Mr. Birdseye noted that the book contained
verse printed in German, and he regretted
having spoken. It wasn’t in the nature of
things for a ballplayer to be reading German
<a name="p385" id="p385"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>385<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>poetry in the original, and he had no time to
waste upon any other than a ballplayer.</p>

<p>In that same instant, though, his glance fell
on the next two passengers, and his heart gave
a glad upward leap in his bosom. Surely the
broad man with the swarthy skin and the
straight black hair must be the Indian. Just
as surely the short, square man alongside, the
owner of that heavy jaw and that slightly up-tilted
nose, could be none but the Richelieu of
managers. Mr. Birdseye almost sprang forward.</p>

<p>“Well, Chief!” he cried genially. “Well,
Swifty! I thought I’d find you. How’s everything?”</p>

<p>Coldly they both regarded him. It was the
short, square man who answered, and the reader
behind put down his volume of Heine to listen.</p>

<p>“Everything would be all right if they’d
only keep these car doors locked,” said the short
man, and he didn’t speak as a true sportsman
should speak&mdash;tone, inflection, pronunciation,
all were wrong. Enthusiasm was lacking, joviality
was woefully missing. He continued, in
the manner rather of a civil engineer&mdash;an impassive
ordinarily civil engineer, say, who was
now slightly irritated about something: “I figure
you’ve made a mistake. This gentleman is
not a chief&mdash;he’s my private secretary. And
my name does not happen to be Swift, if I heard
you right. My name is Dinglefoogle&mdash;Omar
G. Dinglefoogle, of Swedish descent.”</p>

<p><a name="p386" id="p386"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>386<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span>He disengaged his gaze from that of the
abashed Birdseye and resumed his conversation
with his companion at a point where it had
been interrupted:</p>

<p>“Have it your own way, John. Abbey for
yours, but Sargent and Whistler for mine&mdash;yes,
and Remington.”</p>

<p>“But where are you going to find anything to
beat that thing of Abbey’s&mdash;The Search for the
Holy Grail?” It was the swarthy man taking
up the issue. “Every time I go to <span class="nw">Boston&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>Moving onward in a small, self-generated fog
of bewilderment which travelled with him, Mr.
Birdseye heard no more. So moving, he passed
in turn a young man who was bedded down in a
nest of pamphlets and Government bulletins
dealing in the main apparently with topics relating
to forestry or else with intensive farming;
and a young man who napped with his hat over
his eyes; and another young man intently making
notes on the back of an envelope; and
two young men silently examining the mechanism
of a gold watch which plainly was the property
of one of the two; until at the far end of
the car he came to one more young man who,
casting aside a newspaper and straightening to
get the kinks out of his back, showed Mr. Birdseye
a profiled face of a clear pinkish colour,
with a calm, reflective eye set in it under a pale
yellow eyebrow and, above, a mop of hair so
light as to be almost white. Verily there could
be no confusion of identity here. Coincidence
<a name="p387" id="p387"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>387<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>was coincidence, but so unique, so distinctive,
a physical aspect was not to be duplicated outside
of a story book.</p>

<p>“Say, I’d know you anywhere by your pictures,”
said Mr. Birdseye, and extended the
right hand of fellowship.</p>

<p>“That’s the main objection to those pictures&mdash;they
do look a little like me,” replied the
young man with a smile so grave as to verge
upon the melancholy. Half rising, he shook
hands with the other. “Have a seat?” Hospitably
he indicated the cushioned expanse in
front of him and drew in his knees.</p>

<p>Here was proof, added and cumulative. The
voice of the pale-haired young man was as it
should be, a gently modulated r-slurring voice.
Was it not known of all men that Albino Magoon,
the Circassian Beauty of the outfield,
owned allegiance of birth to the Sunny Southland,
Mr. Birdseye’s own land? Bond and
double bond would they share between them.
In a flutter of reviving joy Mr. Birdseye
scrooged in and sat.</p>

<p>The young man, having done the courtesies,
sat back modestly as though awaiting the newcomer’s
pleasure in the matter of choosing a
topic for conversation. Mr. Birdseye lost no
time. He knew the subjects fittest to be discussed.</p>

<p>“Well,” he said, “what do you think about
Chicago’s chances? Think she’s going to give
New York a run for her white alley this year?”</p>

<p><a name="p388" id="p388"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>388<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span>“I’m sure I don’t know, suh.” Such was the
first sentence of the astonishing rejoinder.
“Chicago is growing, awfully fast&mdash;faster than
any big interior city, I presume, but the latest
figures show New York has a greater population
now, including suburbs, than London even.
It’s hardly possible, I reckon, for Chicago to
hope to catch up with New York&mdash;this year or
any other year.”</p>

<p>Puzzled, I must admit, but by no means nonplussed<!-- original reads 'nonplused' -->,
Mr. Birdseye jibed and went about
mentally. As the cant phrase goes, he took a
new tack.</p>

<p>“Say, listen,” he said; “do you know what I
think? I think the Federals gave you-all a rotten
deal. Yes, sir, a rotten deal all the way
through. Naturally down here nearly everybody
feels that way about it&mdash;naturally the
sympathies of nearly everybody in this part of
the country would turn that way anyhow. I
reckon you’d know that without my telling you
how we feel. Of course a good knock-down-and-drag-out
fight is all right, but when you
sit down and figure out the way the Federals
behaved right from the <span class="nw">start&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>The other put up an objecting hand.</p>

<p>“I hope you’ll excuse me, suh,” he said, “but
I don’t believe in keeping those old sores open.
I thought sectionalism was dying out everywhere&mdash;I
hoped it was, anyway. My father
fought the Federals for four years and he died
reconciled. I don’t know why we younger men
<a name="p389" id="p389"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>389<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>shouldn’t be. After all, we’re all Americans
now.”</p>

<p>“I wasn’t speaking of the Federal Army,”
explained Mr. Birdseye, desperately upset. “I
was speaking of the Federal League.”</p>

<p>“Oh, the Federal League!” said the other.
“I beg your pardon, suh. Are you&mdash;are you interested
in baseball?” He put the question
wonderingly.</p>

<p>“Am I interested in&mdash;well, say, ain’t you
interested?”</p>

<p>“Me? Oh, no, suh. I make it a rule never
to discuss the subject. You see, I’m a divinity
student. I reckon you must’ve mistaken me
for somebody else. I was afraid so when you
first spoke. I’m mighty sorry.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I must’ve,” agreed Mr. Birdseye. He
got upon his own feet and stumbled over the
young man’s feet and ran a hand through the
hair on his pestered head. “I guess I must’ve
got in the wrong car.”</p>

<p>“That’s probably it,” said the pale-haired
one. His odd-coloured but ingenuous countenance
expressed solicitude and sympathy for the
stranger’s disappointment. Indeed, it wrinkled
and twitched almost as though this tender-hearted
person meant to shed tears. As if to
hide his emotions, he suddenly reached for his discarded
newspaper and in its opened pages buried
his face to the ears&mdash;ears which slowly turned
from pink to red. When next he spoke it was
from behind the shelter of his newsprint shield,
<a name="p390" id="p390"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>390<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>and his voice seemed choked. “Undoubtedly
that’s it&mdash;you got in the wrong car. Well, good-bye,
my brother&mdash;and God bless and speed you.”</p>

<p>At this precise moment, with the train just
beginning to pull out from Barstow Junction,
with the light-haired man sinking deeper and
deeper inside the opened sheets, and with Mr.
Birdseye teetering on uncertain legs in the aisle,
there came to the latter’s ears what he might
have heard before had his hearing been attuned
for sounds from that quarter. He heard a great
rollicking, whooping, vehement outburst coming
from the next car back, which was likewise
the last car. It had youth in it, that sound did&mdash;the
spirit of unbridled, exuberant youth at
play, and abandon and deviltry and prankishness
and carefreedom. Mr. Birdseye faced
about. He caught up his handbag and, swift
as a courier bearing glad tidings, he sped on
winged feet&mdash;at least those extensive soles almost
approximated wings&mdash;through the cramped
passage flanking the smoking compartment.
Where the two cars clankingly joined beneath
a metal flange he came into collision with a
train butcher just emerging from the rear
sleeper.</p>

<p>Butch’s hair was dishevelled and his collar
awry. He dangled an emptied fruit basket in
one hand and clinked coins together in the palm
of the other. On his face was a grin of comic
dismay and begrudged admiration.</p>

<p>“Some gang back there&mdash;some wild gang!”
<a name="p391" id="p391"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>391<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>he murmured and, dodging adeptly past Mr.
Birdseye, was gone, heading forward.</p>

<p>The searcher rounded the jog of the compartment
reservation, and inside him then his soul
was lifted up and exalted. There could be no
mistake now. Within the confines of this Pullman
romped and rampaged young men and
youths to the number of perhaps twenty.
There seemed to be more than twenty of them;
that, though, was due to the flitting movements
of their rambunctious forms. Norfolk-jacketed
bodies, legs in modishly short trousers deeply
cuffed at the bottoms, tousled heads to which
rakish soft hats and plaid travelling caps adhered
at angles calculated to upset the theory
of the attraction of gravitation, showed here,
there, everywhere, in a confused and shifting
vista. Snappy suit cases, a big, awkward-looking,
cylindrical bag of canvas, leather-faced,
and two or three other boxes in which, to
judge by their shapes, stringed musical instruments
were temporarily entombed, encumbered
a seat near by.</p>

<p>All this Mr. Birdseye’s kindled eye comprehended
in the first quick scrutiny. Also it took
in the posture of a long, lean, lanky giant in his
early twenties, who stood midway of the coach,
balancing himself easily on his legs, for by now
the train was picking up speed. One arm of the
tall athlete&mdash;the left&mdash;was laid along his breast,
and in its crook it held several small, half-ripened
oranges. His right hand would pluck
<a name="p392" id="p392"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>392<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>up an orange, the right arm would wind up, and
then with marvellous accuracy and incredible
velocity the missile would fly, like a tawny-green
streak, out of an open window at some convenient
target. So fast he worked and so well,
it seemed as though a constant stream of citrus
was being discharged through that particular
window. An orange spattered against a signpost
marking the limits of the yard. Two
oranges in instantaneous succession struck the
rounded belly of a water tank, making twin
yellow asterisks where they hit. A fourth,
driven as though by a piston, whizzed past the
nappy head of a darky pedestrian who had
halted to watch the train go by. That darky
ducked just in time.</p>

<p>Mr. Birdseye lunged forward to pay tribute
to the sharpshooter. Beyond peradventure
there could be but one set of muscles on this continent
capable of such marksmanship. But
another confronted him, barring his way, a
stockily built personage with a wide, humorous
face, and yet with authority in all its contour
and lines.</p>

<p>“Well, see who’s here!” he clarioned and literally
he embraced Mr. Birdseye, pinning that
gentleman’s arms to his sides. He bent his
head and put his lips close to Mr. Birdseye’s
flattered ear, the better to be heard above the
uproar dinning about them. “What was the
name?” he inquired.</p>

<p>“Birdseye&mdash;J. Henry Birdseye.”</p>

<p><a name="p393" id="p393"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>393<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span>Continuing to maintain a firm grasp upon
Mr. Birdseye’s coat sleeve the stocky individual
swung about and called for attention:</p>

<p>“Gentlemen, one moment&mdash;one moment, if
you please.”</p>

<p>Plainly he had unquestioned dominion over
this mad and pranksome crew. His fellows
paused in whatever they were doing to give
heed unto his words.</p>

<p>“Boys, it gives me joy to introduce to you
Colonel Birdshot.”</p>

<p>“Birdseye,” corrected his prisoner, overcome
with gratification, not unmixed with embarrassment.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon,” said the master of ceremonies.
Then more loudly again: “I should
have said Col. Birdseye Maple.”</p>

<p>“Three cheers for the walking bedroom set!”
This timely suggestion emanated from a wiry
skylarker who had drawn nigh and was endeavouring
to find Mr. Birdseye’s hand with a
view to shaking it.</p>

<p>Three cheers they were, and right heartily
given too.</p>

<p>“And to what, may I ask&mdash;to what are we
indebted for the pleasure of this unexpected
but nevertheless happy meeting?” asked the
blocky man. One instant he suggested the
prime minister; the next, the court jester. And
was not that as it should be too? It was, if
one might credit what one had read of the king-pin
of managers.</p>

<p><a name="p394" id="p394"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>394<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span>“Why&mdash;why, I just ran over from Anneburg
to meet you and ride in with you&mdash;and sort of
put you onto the ropes and everything,” vouchsafed
Mr. Birdseye.</p>

<p>“Well, isn’t that splendid&mdash;we didn’t expect
it!” Once more he addressed his attentive
fellows:</p>

<p>“Gentlemen, you’ll never guess it until I tell
you. It is none other than the official reception
committee bearing with it the keys of the corporation.
I shrewdly suspect the Colonel has
the words ‘Welcome to Our City’ tattooed upon
his chest.”</p>

<p>“Let’s undress him and see.”</p>

<p>The idea was advanced by the same wire-drawn
youngster who had called for the cheers.
He laid hold on Mr. Birdseye’s collar, but instantly
the happy captive was plucked from his
grasp and passed from one to another of the
clustering group. They squeezed Mr. Birdseye’s
fingers with painfully affectionate force;
they dealt him cordially violent slaps upon the
back. They inquired regarding his own health
and the health of his little ones, and in less than
no time at all, it seemed to him, he, somewhat
jostled and dishevelled, confused but filled
with a tingling bliss, had been propelled the
length of the aisle and back again, and found
himself sitting so he faced the directing genius
of this exuberant coterie of athletes. The rest,
sensing that their leader desired conference with
the newcomer, resumed their diversions, and so
<a name="p395" id="p395"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>395<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>in a small eddy of calm on the edge of a typhoon
of clamour these two&mdash;Birdseye and the
great manager&mdash;conversed together as man to
man.</p>

<p>“And so you ran down to meet us&mdash;that was
bully,” said the blocky man. His mood was
now serious, and Mr. Birdseye set himself to
reply in the same spirit. “What’s the prospects
for a crowd over in Anneburg?”</p>

<p>“Couldn’t be better,” Mr. Birdseye told him.
“Everybody in town that can walk, ride or
crawl will be out to see you fellows play.”</p>

<p>“To see us play&mdash;that’s good!”</p>

<p>“The Mayor is going to be there, and ex-Governor
Featherston&mdash;he’s about the biggest
man we’ve got in Anneburg&mdash;and oh, just
everybody.”</p>

<p>“Whosoever will, let him come, that’s our
motto,” stated his vis-à-vis; “entertainment
for man and beast. You’ll be there of course?”</p>

<p>“In a front seat&mdash;rooting my head off,”
promised Mr. Birdseye, forgetting in the supreme
joy of this supreme moment that he owed
first duty to Anneburg’s own puny contenders.
“Say, you fellows are just exactly like I thought
you’d be&mdash;regular hellions. Well, it’s the old
pep that counts.”</p>

<p>“You said it&mdash;the old pep is the thing.”</p>

<p>“What kind of a trip did you have coming
up?”</p>

<p>“Fine&mdash;fine from the start.”</p>

<p>“And where do you go from Anneburg?”</p>

<p><a name="p396" id="p396"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>396<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span>“Asheville, then Richmond. Anneburg is
the smallest town we play.”</p>

<p>“Don’t think we don’t appreciate it, Swifty.
Say, the Big Fellow certainly can pitch, can’t
he?” Mr. Birdseye pointed toward the flinger
of oranges who, having exhausted his ammunition,
was now half out of a window, contemplating
the flitting landscape. “How’s his arm
going to be this year?”</p>

<p>“Better than ever&mdash;better than ever. I
guess you know about the no-hit game he
pitched last year&mdash;the last game he played?”</p>

<p>“Tell me something about that kid I don’t
know,” boasted Mr. Birdseye. “I’ve followed
him from the time he first broke in.”</p>

<p>“Then you know he’s there with the pipes?”</p>

<p>“The pipes?”</p>

<p>“Sure&mdash;the educated larynx, the talented
tonsils, the silver-lined throat&mdash;in other words,
the gift of song.”</p>

<p>“Why, I didn’t know he sang,” owned Mr.
Birdseye, a mite puzzled.</p>

<p>“That’s it&mdash;let a fellow do one thing better
than anybody else, and they forget his other
accomplishments. Sing? Well, rather! And
punish old John J. Mandolin, too, if anybody
should ask you.”</p>

<p>So saying, the speaker drew forth a bulldog
pipe and proceeded to load it from a leather
tobacco case.</p>

<p>“I don’t have to keep in condition, seeing as
I’m merely running things,” he explained.
<a name="p397" id="p397"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>397<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>“But you bet I make my flock keep in condition&mdash;no
boozing and mighty little cigarette smoking
for them while their little papa’s eye is on
them.”</p>

<p>“I’ve always heard you were strong for discipline,”
said Mr. Birdseye, plastering the flattering
unction on thickly.</p>

<p>“I have to be, with a rowdy outfit like this
one. Look yonder&mdash;that’s a sample of the way
they carry on when the bridle is off.”</p>

<p>Three of these temporarily unhaltered colts
had captured the car porter. Two held him
fast while the third massaged his woolly scalp
with hard knuckles. Half a dozen more
shouted advice to the operator. The porter
broke away and fled, his expression betraying
that he hardly knew whether to feel indignant
or complimented. Mr. Birdseye saw
that the volunteer masseur, now approaching
them, had coal-black hair and snapping black
eyes, and a skin the colour of polished cherry.</p>

<p>“That’s the Chief coming, of course?” opined
Mr. Birdseye. His tone was filled with reverence.</p>

<p>“Sh-h, don’t let him hear you. If I had a
big Indian whatyoumaycallim for a grandfather
I’d advertise it, but he’s a little touchy on
the subject. Great boy though&mdash;one of the
best.”</p>

<p>“Part Pawnee, ain’t he?”</p>

<p>“No; Parsee, I think.”</p>

<p>Mr. Birdseye was going to ask where that
<a name="p398" id="p398"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>398<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>tribe lived, but skylarking broke out in a fresh
quarter and he forgot it. They talked averages
then, or started to. Mr. Birdseye was made
proud to find his companion agreed with him
that Tris Speaker undoubtedly had a shade on
Joe Jackson, and then was just about to take
up the question of Honus Wagner’s ability to
come back after his last season’s slump&mdash;a vital
issue and one upon which he entertained decided
views in the affirmative&mdash;when something occurred.
Without being able to comprehend
exactly how it came about, he discovered himself
all of a sudden forming one link in a human
chain of which six or eight more were likewise
component parts. With arms intertwined and
heads bent toward a common centre, they all
mingled their lusty voices in snatches of song
and glee and roundelay, and he&mdash;he perforce
joined with them. One moment Merrily They
Rolled Along, Rolled Along, Rolled Along&mdash;indeed
they did; the next, From Aunt Dinah’s
Quilting Party they were Seeing Nell-l-l-i-e
Home. Then a single minstrel advanced the
duly credited assertion of parties unnamed that
A Nigger Won’t Steal, whereupon several others
instantly and melodiously responded to the
effect that be this as it may, I Caught Three in
My Cornfield; One Had a Shovel and One
Had a Hoe and if That Ain’t Stealing I Don’t
Know! And so on without cessation for many
fleeting, glorious, golden minutes. Once Mr.
Birdseye, feeling certain he recognised the
<a name="p399" id="p399"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>399<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>blithesome tenor whose wide shoulders his right
arm encompassed, broke off his carolling long
enough to say:</p>

<p>“Some doings, eh, Flying Jenny?”</p>

<p>Whereat the singer, thus jovially addressed,
conferred a wink and a grin upon him and
shouted back: “Don’t be so blamed formal&mdash;just
call me Jane!” and then skillfully picked
up the tune again and kept right on tenoring.
They were all still enmeshed and in all unison
enriching the pent-up confines of their car with
close harmonies when the train began to check
up bumpingly, and advised by familiar objects
beginning to pass the windows Mr. Birdseye
realised that they approached their destination.
It didn’t seem humanly possible that so much
time had elapsed with such miraculous rapidity,
but there was the indisputable evidence in
Langford’s Real Estate Division and the trackside
warehouses of Brazzell Brothers’ Pride of
Dixie fertilizer works. From a chosen and accepted
comrade he now became also a guide.</p>

<p>“Fellows!” he announced, breaking out of
the ring, “we’ll be in in just a minute&mdash;this is
Anneburg!”</p>

<p>Coincidentally with this announcement the
conductor appeared at the forward end of the
car and in a word gave confirmatory evidence.
Of the car porter there was no sign.
Duty called him to be present, but prudence
bade him nay. He had discretion, that
porter.</p>

<p><a name="p400" id="p400"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>400<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span>The song that was being sung at that particular
moment&mdash;whatever it was&mdash;was suffered to
languish and die midway of a long-drawn refrain.
There was a scattering of the minstrels
to snatch up suit cases, bags and other portable
impedimenta.</p>

<p>“I’ll ride up to the hotel with you,” suggested
Mr. Birdseye, laying a detaining hand
upon the master’s elbow. “If I get a chance
there’s something I want to tell you on the
way.” He was just remembering he had forgotten
to mention that treacherous soft spot
back of centre field.</p>

<p>“You bet your blameless young life you’ll
ride with us!” answered back the other, reaching
for a valise.</p>

<p>“What? Lose our honoured and esteemed
reception committee now? Not a chance!”
confirmed an enormous youth whose bass tones
fitted him for the life of a troubadour, but whose
breadth of frame qualified him for piano-moving
or centre-rushing. With a great bear-hug
he lifted Mr. Birdseye in his arms, roughly
fondling him.</p>

<p>“You’re going to the Hotel Balboa, of
course,” added Mr. Birdseye, regaining his feet
and his breath as the caressing grip of the giant
relaxed.</p>

<p>“Hotel Balboa is right, old Pathfinder.”</p>

<p>“Then we’d all better take the hotel bus uptown,
hadn’t we?”</p>

<p>“Just watch us take it.”</p>

<p><a name="p401" id="p401"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>401<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span>“I’ll lay eight to five that bus has never been
properly taken before now.”</p>

<p>“But it’s about to be.” He who uttered this
prophecy was the brisk youngster who had
objected to being designated by so elaborated a
title as Flying Jenny.</p>

<p>“All out!”</p>

<p>Like a chip on the crest of a mountain torrent
Mr. Birdseye was borne down the car steps
as the train halted beneath the shed of the
Anneburg station. Across the intervening
tracks, through the gate and the station and out
again at the far side of the waiting room the
living freshet poured. As he was carried along
with it, the Indian being at his right hand, the
orange thrower at his left, and behind him irresistible
forces ramping and roaring, Mr. Birdseye
was aware of a large crowd, of Nick Cornwall,
of others locally associated with the destinies
of the Anneburg team, of many known to
him personally or by name, all staring hard,
with puzzled looks, as he went whirling on by.
Their faces were visible a fleeting moment, then
vanished like faces seen in a fitful dream, and
now the human ground swell had surrounded
and inundated a large motorbus, property of the
Hotel Balboa.</p>

<p>Strong arms reached upward and, as though
he had been a child, plucked from his perch
the dumfounded<!-- legitimate spelling: OED --> driver of this vehicle, with a
swing depositing him ten feet distant, well out
of harm’s way. A youth who plainly
<a name="p402" id="p402"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>402<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>understood the mystery of motors clambered up,
nimble as a monkey, taking seat and wheel.
Another mounted alongside of him and rolled
up a magazine to make a coaching horn of it.
Another and yet another followed, until a cushioned
space designed for two only held four.
As pirates aforetime have boarded a wallowing
galleon the rest of the crew boarded the body of
the bus. They entered by door or by window,
whichever chanced to be handier, first firing their
hand baggage in with a splendid disregard of
consequences.</p>

<p>In less than no time at all, to tallyho tootings,
to whoops and to yells and to snatches of
melody, the Hotel<!-- original reads 'Hotal' --> Balboa bus was rolling
through a startled business district, bearing in
it, upon it and overflowing from it full twice
as many fares as its builder had imagined it
conceivably would ever contain when he
planned its design and its accommodations.
Side by side on the floor at its back door with
feet out in space, were jammed together Mr. J.
Henry Birdseye and the aforesaid blocky chieftain
of the band. Teams checked up as the
caravan rolled on. Foot travellers froze in
their tracks to stare at the spectacle. Birdseye
saw them. They saw Birdseye. And he
saw that they saw and felt that be the future
what it might, life for him could never bring a
greater, more triumphant, more exultant moment
than this.</p>

<p>“Is that the opera house right ahead?”
<a name="p403" id="p403"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>403<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>inquired his illustrious mate as the bus jounced
round the corner of Lattimer Street.</p>

<p>“No, that’s the new Second National Bank,”
explained Mr. Birdseye between jolts. “The
opera house is four doors further down&mdash;see,
right there&mdash;just next to where that sign says
‘Tascott &amp; Nutt, Hardware.’”</p>

<p>Simultaneously those who rode in front and
atop must likewise have read the sign of Tascott
&amp; Nutt. For the bus, as though on signal,
swerved to the curb before this establishment
and stopped dead short, and in chorus a dozen
strong voices called for Mr. Nutt, continuing
to call until a plump, middle-aged gentleman
in his shirt sleeves issued from the interior and
crossed the sidewalk, surprise being writ large
upon his face. When he had drawn near
enough, sinewy hands stretched forth and
pounced upon him, and as the bus resumed its
journey he most unwillingly was dragged at an
undignified dogtrot alongside a rear wheel while
strange, tormenting questions were shouted
down at him:</p>

<p>“Oh, Mr. Nutt, how’s your dear old coco?”</p>

<p>“And how’s your daughter Hazel?&mdash;charming
girl, Hazel!”</p>

<p>“And your son, Philip Bertram? Don’t tell
me the squirrels have been after that dear Phil
Bert again!”</p>

<p>“You’ll be careful about the chipmunks this
summer, won’t you, Mr. Nutt&mdash;for our sakes?”</p>

<p>“Old Man Nutt is a good old soul.”</p>

<p><a name="p404" id="p404"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>404<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span>But this last was part of a song, and not a
question at all.</p>

<p>The victim wrested himself free at last and
stood in the highroad speechless with indignation.
Lack of breath was likewise a contributing
factor. Mr. Birdseye observed, as they
drew away from the panting figure, that the
starting eyes of Mr. Nutt were fixed upon him
recognisingly and accusingly, and realised that
he was in some way being blamed for the discomfiture
of that solid man and that he had
made a sincere enemy for life. But what cared
he? Meadow larks, golden breasted, sat in his
short ribs and sang to his soul.</p>

<p>And now they had drawn up at the Hotel Balboa,
and with Birdseye still in the van they had
piled off and were swirling through the lobby
to splash up against the bulkhead of the clerk’s
desk, behind which, with a wide professional
smile of hospitality on his lips, Head Clerk Ollie
Bates awaited their coming and their pleasure.</p>

<p>“You got our wire?” demanded of him the
young manager. “Rooms all ready?”</p>

<p>“Rooms all ready, <span class="nw">Mister&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>“Fine and dandy! We’ll go right up and
wash up for lunch. Here’s the list&mdash;copy the
names onto the register yourself. Where’s the
elevator? Oh, there it is. All aboard, boys!
No, wait a minute,” countermanded this young
commander who forgot nothing, as he turned and
confronted Mr. Birdseye. “Before parting, we
will give three cheers for our dear friend, guide
<a name="p405" id="p405"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>405<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>and well-wisher, Colonel Birdseye Maple. All
together:</p>

<p>“Whee! <em>Whee!</em> <span class="smc">Whee</span>!”</p>

<p>The last and loudest Whee died away; the
troupe charged through and over a skirmish
line of darky bell hops; they stormed the elevator
cage. Half in and half out of it their
chief paused to wave a hand to him whom they
had just honoured.</p>

<p>“See you later, Colonel,” he called across the
intervening space. “You said you’d be there
when we open up, you know.”</p>

<p>“I’ll be there, Swifty, on a front seat!”
pledged Mr. Birdseye happily.</p>

<p>The overloaded elevator strained and started
and vanished upward, vocal to the last. In
the comparative calm which ensued Mr. Birdseye,
head well up, chest well out, and thumbs in
the arm openings of a distended waistcoat,
lounged easily but with the obvious air of a
conqueror back toward the desk and Mr. Ollie
Bates.</p>

<p>“Some noisy bunch!” said Mr. Bates admiringly.
“Say, J. Henry, where did they pick
you up?”</p>

<p>“They didn’t pick me up, I picked them up&mdash;met
’em over at Barstow and rode in with
’em.”</p>

<p>“Seems like it didn’t take you long to make
friends with ’em,” commented Mr. Bates.</p>

<p>“It didn’t take me half a minute. Easiest
bunch to get acquainted with you ever saw in
<a name="p406" id="p406"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>406<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>your life, Ollie. And kidders? Well, they
wrote kidding&mdash;that’s all&mdash;words and music.
I wish you could a-seen them stringing old man
’Lonzo Nutt down the street! I like to died!”
He unbent a trifle; after all, Mr. Bates was an
old friend. “Say, Ollie, that gang won’t do a
thing to our little old scrub team this afternoon,
with Long Leaf Pinderson pitching. I saw him
in action&mdash;with oranges. <span class="nw">He&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>“Say, listen, J. Henry,” broke in Mr. Bates.
“Who in thunder do you think that gang is
you’ve been associating with?”</p>

<p>“Think it is? Who would it be but the
Moguls?”</p>

<p>“Moguls?”</p>

<p>A convulsion seized and overcame Mr. Bates.
He bent double, his distorted face in his hands,
his shoulders heaving, weird sounds issuing from
his throat. Then lifting his head, he opened
that big mouth of his, afflicting the adjacent air
with raucous and discordant laughter.</p>

<p>“Moguls! Moguls! Say, you need to have
your head looked into. Why, J. Henry, the Moguls
came in on the twelve-forty-five and Nick
Cornwall and the crowd met ’em and they’re
down to the Hotel Esplanade right this minute,
I reckon. We tried to land ’em for the Balboa,
but it seemed like they wanted a quiet
hotel. Well, they’ll have their wish at the
Esplanade!”</p>

<p>“Then who&mdash;then who are these?”</p>

<p>It was the broken, faltering accent of Mr.
<a name="p407" id="p407"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>407<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>Birdseye, sounded wanly and as from a long
way off.</p>

<p>“These? Why, it’s the College Glee Club
from Chickasaw Tech., down in Alabama, that’s
going to give a concert at the opera house to-night.
And you thought all the time you were
with the Moguls? Well, you poor simp!”</p>

<p>In addition to simp Mr. Bates also used the
words boob, sucker, chunk of Camembert and
dub in this connection. But it is doubtful if
Mr. Birdseye heard him now. A great roaring,
as of dashing cataracts and swirling rapids, filled
his ears as he fled away, blindly seeking some
sanctuary wherein to hide himself from the gaze
of mortal man.</p>

<p>Remaining to be told is but little; but that
little looms important as tending to prove that
truth sometimes is stranger than fiction. With
Swifty Megrue coaching, with Magnus, the Big
Chief, backstopping, with Pinderson, master of
the spitball, in the box twirling, nevertheless
and to the contrary notwithstanding, the Anneburg
team that day mopped up, the score
standing:</p>

<p class="newchap"><span class="dropcap ml6">On</span> this voyage the <i>Mesopotamia</i> was
to sail at midnight. It was now, to be
precise about it, eleven forty-five
<span class="allsc">P.&nbsp;M.</span><!-- original unspaced --> and some odd seconds; and they
were wrestling the last of the heavy luggage
aboard. The Babel-babble that distinguishes
a big liner’s departure was approaching its climax
of acute hysteria, when two well-dressed,
youngish men joined the wormlike column of
eleventh-hour passengers mounting a portable
bridge labelled First Cabin which hyphenated
the strip of dark water between ship and shore.
They were almost the last persons to join the
line, coming in such haste along the dock that
the dock captain on duty at the foot of the canvas-sided
gangway let them pass without question.</p>

<p>Except that these two men were much of a
size and at a first glance rather alike in general
aspect; and except that one of them, the rearmost,
bore two bulging handbags while the
<a name="p409" id="p409"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>409<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>other kept his hands muffled in a grey tweed
ulster that lay across his arms, there was nothing
about them or either of them to distinguish
them from any other belated pair of men in
that jostling procession of the flurried and the
hurried. Oh, yes, one of them had a moustache
and the other had none.</p>

<p>Indian file they went up the gangway and
past the second officer, who stood at the head
of it; and still tandem they pushed and were
pushed along through the jam upon the deck.
The second man, the one who bore the handbags,
gave them over to a steward who had
jumped forward when he saw them coming.
He hesitated then, looking about him.</p>

<p>“Come on, it’s all right,” said the first man.</p>

<p>“How about the tickets? Don’t we have to
show them first?” inquired the other.</p>

<p>“No, not now,” said his companion. “We
can go direct to our stateroom.” The same
speaker addressed the steward:</p>

<p>“D-forty,” he said briskly.</p>

<p>“Quite right, sir,” said the steward. “D-forty.
Right this way, sir; if you please,
sir.”</p>

<p>With the dexterity born of long practice the
steward, burdened though he was, bored a path
for himself and them through the crowd. He
led them from the deck, across a corner of a
big cabin that was like a hotel lobby, and down
flights of broad stairs from B-deck to C and
from C-deck to D, and thence aft along a
<a name="p410" id="p410"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>410<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>narrow companionway until he came to a cross
hall where another steward stood.</p>

<p>“Two gentlemen for D-forty,” said their
guide. Surrendering the handbags to this other
functionary, he touched his cap and vanished
into thin air, magically, after the custom of
ancient Arabian genii and modern British steamship
servants.</p>

<p>“’Ere you are, sirs,” said the second steward.
He opened the door of a stateroom and stood
aside to let them in. Following in behind them
he deposited the handbags in mathematical
alignment upon the floor and spoke a warning:
“We’ll be leavin’ in a minute or two now,
but it’s just as well, sir, to keep your stateroom
door locked until we’re off&mdash;thieves are about
sometimes in port, you know, sir. Was there
anything else, sir?” He addressed them in the
singular, but considered them, so to speak, in
the plural. “I’m the bedroom steward, sir,”
he added in final explanation.</p>

<p>The passenger who had asked concerning the
tickets looked about him curiously, as though
the interior arrangement of a steamship stateroom
was to him strange.</p>

<p>“So you’re the bedroom steward,” he said.
“What’s your name?”</p>

<p>“Lawrence, sir.”</p>

<p>“Lawrence what?”</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon, sir?” said the steward,
looking puzzled.</p>

<p>“He wants to know your first name,”
<a name="p411" id="p411"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>411<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>explained the other prospective occupant of D-forty.
This man had sat himself down upon
the edge of the bed, still with his grey ulster
folded forward across his arms as though the
pockets held something valuable and must be
kept in a certain position, just so, to prevent
the contents spilling out.</p>

<p>“’Erbert Lawrence, sir, thank you, sir,” said
the steward, his face clearing, “I’ll be ’andy
if you ring, sir.” He backed out. “Nothing
else, sir? I’ll see to your ’eavy luggage in the
mornin’. Will there be any trunks for the
stateroom?”</p>

<p>“No trunks,” said the man on the bed.
“Just some suitcases. They came aboard just
ahead of us, I think.”</p>

<p>“Right, sir,” said the accommodating Lawrence.
“I’ll get your tickets in the morning
and take them to the purser, if you don’t mind.
Thank you, sir.” And with that he bowed
himself out and was gone.</p>

<p>As the door closed behind this thoughtful and
accommodating servitor the fellow travellers
looked at each other for a moment steadily,
much as though they might be sharers of a
common secret that neither cared to mention
even between themselves. The one who stood
spoke first:</p>

<p>“I guess I’ll go up and see her pull out,” he
said. “I’ve never seen a ship pull out; it’s a
new thing to me. Want to go?”</p>

<p>The man nursing the ulster shook his head.</p>

<p><a name="p412" id="p412"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>412<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span>“All right, then,” said the first. He pitched
his own topcoat, which he had been carrying
under his arm, upon the lone chair. “I’ll be
back pretty soon.” He glanced keenly at the
one small porthole, looked about the stateroom
once more, then stepped across the threshold
and closed the door. The lock clicked.</p>

<p>Left alone, the other man sat for a half minute
or so as he was, with his head tilted forward in
an attitude of listening. Then he stood up
and with a series of shrugging, lifting motions,
jerked the ulster forward so that it slipped
through the loop of his arms upon the floor.
Had the efficient Lawrence returned at that
moment it is safe to say he would have sustained
a profound shock, although it is equally safe
to say he would have made desperate efforts to
avoid showing his emotions. The man was
manacled. Below his white shirt-cuffs his wrists
were encircled by snug-fitting, shiny bracelets
of steel united by a steel chain of four short
links. That explained his rather peculiar way
of carrying his ulster and his decidedly awkward
way of ridding himself of it.</p>

<p>He stepped across the room and with his
coupled hands tried the knob of the door. The
knob turned, but the bolt had been set from
the outside. He was locked in. With his foot
he dragged forward a footstool, kicking it close
up against the panels so that should any person
coming in open the door suddenly, the stool
would retard that person’s entrance for a
<a name="p413" id="p413"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>413<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>moment anyway. He faced about then, considering
his next move. The circular pane of thick
glass in the porthole showed as a black target
in the white wall; through it only blankness
was visible. D-deck plainly was well down in
the ship’s hull, below the level of promenades
and probably not very far above the waterline.
Nevertheless, the handcuffed man crossed over
and drew the short silken curtains across the
window, making the seclusion of his quarters
doubly secure.</p>

<p>Now, kneeling upon the floor, he undid the
hasps of the two handbags, opened them and
began rummaging in their cluttered depths.
Doing all these things, he moved with a sureness
and celerity which showed that he had
worn his bonds for an appreciable space of
time and had accustomed himself to using his
two hands upon an operation where, unhampered,
he might have used one or the other,
but not both at once. His chain clinked briskly
as he felt about in the valises. From them he
first got out two travelling caps&mdash;one a dark
grey cap, the other a cap of rather a gaudy
check pattern; also, a plain razor, a safety razor
and a box of cigars. He examined the safety
razor a moment, then slipped it back into the
flap pocket where it belonged; took a cigar from
the box and put the box back into the grip;
tried on first one of the travelling caps and
then the other, and returned them to the places
from which he had taken them; and reclosed
<a name="p414" id="p414"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>414<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>and refastened the grips themselves. But he
took the other razor and dropped it in a certain
place, close down to the floor at the foot
of one of the beds.</p>

<p>He shoved the footstool away from the door,
and, after dusting off his knees, he went and
stood at the porthole gazing out into the night
through a cranny in the curtains. The ship no
longer nuzzled up alongside the dock like a
great sucking pig under the flanks of an even
greater mother-sow; she appeared to stand still
while the dock seemed to be slipping away
from her rearward; but the man who looked
out into the darkness was familiar enough with
that illusion. With his manacled hands crossed
upon his waistcoat and the cigar hanging unlighted
between his lips, he watched until the
liner had turned and was swinging down
stream, heading for the mouth of the river and
the bay.</p>

<p>He lit the cigar, then, and once more sat himself
down upon the edge of the bed. He puffed
away steadily. His head was bent forward
and his hands dangled between his knees in
such ease as the snugness of the bracelets and
the shortness of the chain permitted. Looking
in at him you would have said he was planning
something; that he was considering various
problems. He was still there in that same
hunching position, but the cigar had burned
down two-thirds of its length, when the lock
snicked a warning and his companion re-entered,
<a name="p415" id="p415"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>415<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>bearing a key with which he relocked the door
upon the inner side.</p>

<p>“Well,” said the newcomer, “we’re on our
way.” There was no reply to this. He took off
his derby hat and tossed it aside, and began
unbuttoning his waistcoat.</p>

<p>“Making yourself comfortable, eh?” he went
on as though trying to manufacture conversation.
The manacled one didn’t respond. He
merely canted his head, the better to look into
the face of his travel mate.</p>

<p>“Say, look here,” demanded the new arrival,
his tone and manner changing. “What’s the
use, your nursing that grouch?”</p>

<p>Coming up the gangway, twenty minutes before,
they might have passed, at a casual glance,
for brothers. Viewed now as they faced each
other in the quiet of this small room such a mistake
could not have been possible. They did
not suggest brothers; for all that they were
much the same in build and colouring they did
not even suggest distant cousins. About the
sitting man there were abundant evidences of
a higher and more cultured organism than the
other possessed; the difference showed in costume,
in manner, in speech. Even wearing
handcuffs he displayed, without trying to do
so, a certain superiority in poise and assurance.
In a way his companion seemed vaguely aware
of this. It seemed to make him&mdash;what shall I
say?&mdash;uneasy; maybe a bit envious; possibly
arousing in him the imitative instinct. Judging
<a name="p416" id="p416"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>416<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>of him by his present aspect and the intonations
of his voice, a shrewd observer of men and motives
might have said that he was amply satisfied
with the progress of the undertaking which
he had now in hand, but that he lately had
ceased to be entirely satisfied with himself.</p>

<p>“Say, Bronston,” he repeated, “I tell you
there’s no good nursing the grouch. I haven’t
done anything all through this matter except
what I thought was necessary. I’ve acted that
way from the beginning, ain’t I?”</p>

<p>“Have you heard me complain?” parried the
gyved man. He blew out a mouthful of smoke.</p>

<p>“No, I haven’t, not since you made the first
kick that day I found you out in Denver. But
a fellow can’t very well travel twenty-five hundred
miles with another fellow, sharing the same
stateroom with him and all that, without guessing
what’s in the other fellow’s mind.”</p>

<p>There was another little pause.</p>

<p>“Well,” said the man upon the bed, “we’ve
got this far. What’s the programme from this
point on regarding these decorations?” He
raised his hands to indicate what he meant.</p>

<p>“That’s what I want to talk with you about,”
answered the other. “The rest of the folks on
this boat don’t know anything about us&mdash;not
a blessed thing. The officers don’t know&mdash;nor
the crew, nor any of the passengers, I reckon.
To them we’re just two ordinary Americans
crossing the ocean together on business or
pleasure. You give me your promise not to
<a name="p417" id="p417"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>417<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>make any breaks of any sort, and I’ll take those
things off you and not put them on again until
just before we land. You know I want to make
this trip as easy as I can for you.”</p>

<p>“What earthly difference would it make
whether I gave you my promise or not? Suppose,
as you put it, I did make a break? Where
would I break for out in the middle of the Atlantic
Ocean? Are you still afraid of yourself?”</p>

<p>“Certainly not; certainly I ain’t afraid. At
that, you’ve been back and forth plenty of
times across the ocean, and you know all the
ropes on a ship and I don’t. Still, I ain’t afraid.
But I’d like to have your promise.”</p>

<p>“I won’t give it,” said he of the handcuffs
promptly. “I’m through with making offers
to you. Four days ago when you caught up
with me, I told you I would go with you and
make no resistance&mdash;make no attempt to get
away from you&mdash;if you’d only leave my limbs
free. You knew as well as I did that I was willing
to waive extradition and go back without
any fuss or any delay, in order to keep my
people in this country from finding out what a
devil’s mess I’d gotten myself into over on the
other side. You knew I was not really a criminal,
that I’d done nothing at all which an
American court would construe as a crime. You
knew that because I was an American the British
courts would probably be especially hard
upon me. And you knew too&mdash;you found that
part out for yourself without my telling
<a name="p418" id="p418"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>418<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>you&mdash;that I was intending to go back to England
at the first chance. You knew that all I needed
was a chance to get at certain papers and documents
and produce them in open court to prove
that I was being made a scapegoat; you knew
that if I had just two days free on British soil,
in which to get the books from the place those
lying partners of mine hid them, I could save
myself from doing penal servitude. That was
why I meant to go back of my own accord.
That was why I offered to give you my word
of honour that I would not attempt to get away.
Did you listen? No!”</p>

<p>“Well, didn’t I make the whole thing as easy
for you as I could?” protested his companion.
He spoke as if in self-defence, or at least in
extenuation.</p>

<p>“Easy? Didn’t you put these things on me?
Haven’t I worn them every minute since then,
awake or asleep, except when I was dressing or
undressing?”</p>

<p>“What’s the use of going into all that all over
again? This was too big a case for me to be
taking any risks. I’d had a hard enough job
locating you; I couldn’t afford to lose you.
Let me ask you a few questions: Didn’t we
travel all the way from Denver in a stateroom,
so that outside of the conductors and a couple
of porters there wasn’t a soul knew you was
in trouble? Didn’t I show you how to carry
that overcoat over your arms when we were
changing cars at Chicago, and again coming
<a name="p419" id="p419"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>419<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>across New York to-night, so’s nobody would
catch on? Didn’t I steer clear of reporters all
along the line? Didn’t I keep it all a secret
when I was sending the wire on ahead to book
the passage?”</p>

<p>He paused; then remembered something else:</p>

<p>“Didn’t I go to the trouble of buying a
lighter pair of cuffs than the ones I usually use
and having an extra link set in the chain so as
to keep your arms from cramping, wearing
them? Yes, I did&mdash;I did all those things and
you can’t deny it.</p>

<p>“Nobody on this boat suspects anything,”
he went on. “Nobody here knows you’re
Bronston, wanted in London for that Atlas Investment
Company swindle, and I’m Keller,
chief operative for the Sharkey Agency. So far
as anybody else knows we’re just Mr. Brown
and Mr. Cole, a couple of friends travelling together.
Until the day we land over there on
the other side you can keep on being Mr. Brown
and I’ll keep on being Mr. Cole. I’ll keep this
stateroom door locked at night just to be on
the safe side. And seeing as we’ve got seats
together at the same table I guess we’d better
make a point of taking our meals together at
the same time. Otherwise, you can do just
what you please and go where you please and
I won’t bother you. These folks on this boat
will think we’re just a couple of pretty close
friends.” He fished a key ring out of his pocket,
selected a certain key and bent over the other
<a name="p420" id="p420"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>420<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>man. “Here, hold your hands up for a minute.
You ought to be glad enough to get rid of those
darbies. There!”</p>

<p>He lifted the opened bracelets off his prisoner’s
wrists and pitched them, clinking, upon
the bedcover.</p>

<p>“Have it your own way,” said the freed
Bronston. “But remember, I’ve had my say.
I’m making no pledges, now or hereafter.”
With his fingers, which were long and slender,
he chafed his flesh where the steel had bruised
it red.</p>

<p>“Oh, all right, all right,” answered Keller;
“I’m willing to take the chance&mdash;although
there ain’t really any chance to take. I’ll get
these things out of sight first thing.”</p>

<p>He picked up the handcuffs and dropped
them into a pocket of his ulster where it lay
on the one chair in the room, and wadded a
handkerchief down into the pocket upon them.
“Now, then, everything is shipshape and proper.
There’s no reason why we can’t be pals for
three or four days anyway. And now what do
you say to turning in and getting a good night’s
rest? I’m good and tired and I guess you are
too.”</p>

<p>Whistling to himself like a man well satisfied
with the latest turn in a difficult situation, he
began to undress. The other followed suit.
They were both in their pajamas and both were
in bed and the lights had been put out before
Bronston spoke:</p>

<p><a name="p421" id="p421"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>421<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span>“Mind you, Keller,” he said, “I’m not fooled
to any great extent by this change in attitude
on your part.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” asked Keller sharply.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Bronston, “I can’t help but
realise that you’ve got a selfish and a personal
motive of your own for doing what you’ve just
done. You’re bound to know that if the truth
about us were to get out the people on this boat
probably wouldn’t value your company any
higher than they’d value mine&mdash;maybe not so
highly as they might value mine.”</p>

<p>Keller sat up in bed.</p>

<p>“I don’t get you,” he said. “Just what do
you mean by that?”</p>

<p>“You’re a private detective, aren’t you?”</p>

<p>“Well, what of it?” demanded Keller.
“What’s wrong with my being a private detective?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t mean to hurt your feelings,” said
Bronston, suddenly grown drowsy. He settled
his head down in the pillow and rolled over on
his side, turning his back to his roommate.
“Let’s go to sleep.”</p>

<p>Instantly he seemed to be off; he began drawing
long, heavy breaths. With a snort Keller
settled down, uttering grumbled protests in an
injured and puzzled tone. Presently he slept,
too, with the choky snores of a very weary man.</p>

<p>So far as we know they both slept the sleep
of travel-worn men until morning. It was
seven o’clock and the sunlight was flooding in
<a name="p422" id="p422"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>422<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>at the porthole when their bathroom steward
knocked upon the outer panels of their door, at
first softly, then more briskly. When they had
roused and answered him, he told them that
their baths were ready and waiting for them;
also that the weather was fine and the sea
smooth. It was Bronston who went first to
the bathroom. He had come back, and was
dressing himself when Keller, after clearing his
throat several times, reopened a subject which
seemingly had laid uppermost in his dormant
mind while he slept.</p>

<p>“Say, Bronston,” he began in an aggrieved
voice, “what made you say what you said just
after we turned in last night&mdash;about private
detectives, you know?”</p>

<p>“Oh, let it drop,” answered Bronston, as
though the topic were of no consequence.</p>

<p>“No,” pressed Keller, “I won’t let it drop.
I’d like to know what you meant. I don’t care
much for that sort of talk.”</p>

<p>Bronston had his shaving kit open and was
soaping his cheeks in front of a small mirror at
a stationary washstand in the corner of the
room. He turned with the lather brush in his
hand.</p>

<p>“If you insist then,” he said, “I’ll tell you
what I meant. If the facts about our relationship
should get out&mdash;if the truth should leak
out in any way&mdash;I’m inclined to think there
might be some sympathy for me aboard this
ship. People are apt to have a sympathy for
<a name="p423" id="p423"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>423<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>any man who’s in trouble through no real fault
of his own, especially as there are apt to be
people on this boat&mdash;Americans&mdash;who’ve heard
some of the inside history of this trouble I’m in.
They might believe me when I told them that
I was an innocent party to the transaction,
especially as there is no way, as things stand
now, of my proving my innocence. But you’re
a private detective, and at the risk of wounding
your feelings I’m going to repeat something
which you probably realise already, and that
is that people at large don’t particularly fancy
a person of your calling in life. No, nor the
calling either. I presume you remember, don’t
you, what the biggest detective in America said
not so very long ago in a signed article? He
said most of the private detective agencies were
recruited from among ex-convicts&mdash;said a big
percentage of the private detectives in the
United States were jailbirds and evidence-fixers
and blackmailers and hired thugs!”</p>

<p>“I don’t care what Burns or anybody else
said.” Keller’s voice betokened indignation.
“I may not have had as much education as
some other people, but I’ve made my own way
in the world and I’m no crook, nor no old lag
neither. There’s nobody got anything on me.
Besides, unless somebody tells ’em, how’re
they going to know what line of business I’m
in, any more than they’ll<!-- original reads "thay'll" --> know, just from looking
at you, that you’re on your way back to
London to stand trial for a felony?”</p>

<p><a name="p424" id="p424"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>424<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span>“My friend,” said Bronston gently, “everything
about you spells private detective.
You’ve got it written all over you in letters a
foot high.”</p>

<p>“What now, for instance, gives me away?”
There was incredulity in the question, but also
there was a tinge of doubtfulness too.</p>

<p>“Everything about you, or nearly everything,
gives you away&mdash;your clothes, your shoes, your
moustache. But particularly it’s your shoes
and your moustache. I wonder why all detectives
wear those broad-toed, heavy-soled
shoes?” he added, half to himself.</p>

<p>“What’s wrong with my moustache?” asked
Keller, craning to contemplate himself over
Bronston’s shoulder in the mirror. “Seems to
me you used to wear a moustache yourself.
The description that was sent to our people
said you wore one, and your not wearing it
made it all the harder for me to trail you when
I was put on the case.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I cut mine off months ago,” said Bronston,
“and besides it was always a modest,
close-cropped affair. I never wore the ends of
my moustache turned up like a cow’s horns.”
He glanced at Keller quizzically. “Honestly,
aside from any other considerations, I think
you’d look better without one.”</p>

<p>“Let’s drop the moustache part,” said Keller,
who seemed nettled. “Tell me, what’s wrong
with my clothes?”</p>

<p>“To be frank,” criticised Bronston, “you run
<a name="p425" id="p425"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>425<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>just a bit to extremes. There’s that cap you
bought yesterday evening when we stopped at
that store on our way across town. It struck
me as being&mdash;well, a trifle loud.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see anything wrong with this cap,
if you’re asking me,” said Keller. He drew it
forth from his opened handbag and slipped it
on his head. It slipped down until his ears
stopped it; its owner whistled in astonishment.
“Yes, by gee!” he exclaimed, “there is something
wrong with it too&mdash;it’s too large.” He
drew it off and examined the little tag pasted
in the crown. “Why, it’s a full half size too
large.” He turned to Bronston.</p>

<p>“You told the clerk what numbers we wanted.
Remember, don’t you, offering to attend
to that while I was getting me a bathrobe, so
as to save time? See if he made any mistake
in yours?”</p>

<p>Bronston slid on the cap he had bought, a
plain grey one; it stuck on the top of his head.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said, “the idiot must have got
the sizes twisted. This one is a half size too
small for me.”</p>

<p>“And mine’s a half size too large,” said
Keller. “I suppose we’ll have to trade.”</p>

<p>“There’s nothing else to do,” said Bronston,
“although I can’t say I fancy this plaid design
much.”</p>

<p>In accordance with the plan of Keller, as
stated the night before, they went to breakfast
together to find that they had been assigned
<a name="p426" id="p426"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>426<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>places at a five-seated, circular table on the
balcony of the dining saloon. Their tablemates
were an elderly couple, who said little to each
other and nothing at all to strangers, and a
tall, reserved, exceedingly silent Englishman.
The indefinable something that marked these
two men as hailing from different circles and
different environments was accentuated in their
table manners. Keller ate correctly enough,
but there was a suggestion of grossness about
him, an awkwardness in his fashion of holding
his fork while he cut his ham. But he watched
Bronston closely, and before the end of the
meal had begun to copy Bronston’s method of
handling a fork.</p>

<p>They had quit the dining room and sought
out the location of their deck chairs when, for
the first time, the detective seemed to become
aware that Bronston’s cheeks were rosy and
smooth, whereas a roughened stubble covered
his own jowls. “I think I’ll go below and take
a shave,” he said, running the palm of his hand
over his chops.</p>

<p>“Use my safety, if you feel like it,” suggested
Bronston casually. “There’s a new blade in
it.”</p>

<p>Half an hour later, when Bronston invaded
the stateroom to get a pocketful of cigars, Keller
stood facing the mirror, putting on his collar
and tie.</p>

<p>“I couldn’t find my razor,” he said, with his
head turned away from Bronston; “I must’ve
<a name="p427" id="p427"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>427<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>left it on that Chicago train. And yet I’d have
sworn I put it into my valise. So I had to
use yours. But you were wrong when you said
it had a new blade in it. If that’s a new blade
I’ll eat it. It mighty near pulled my upper lip
off.”</p>

<p>“Your upper lip?” echoed Bronston instantly.</p>

<p>“Sure,” said Keller. There was a touch of
embarrassment in his tone as he faced Bronston.
“I took your advice about this moustache
of mine&mdash;clipped it close with the scissors
and then gave myself the twice-over with your
safety.” His upper lip showed bare; the skin
had a bleached look and was raw from the
scraping it had just undergone.</p>

<p>As Keller passed out of the room, caressing
the place where his moustache had been,
Bronston noted that Keller had made other
changes in his person. Keller had exchanged
the bright green tie which he wore at breakfast
for a dull brown bow; and he had put on a
lighter pair of shoes&mdash;patent-leather shoes,
with thin soles and buttoned uppers. His
broad-toed, heavy-soled pair showed under his
bed where he had shoved them.</p>

instance it assuredly was, the majority of the
passengers upon a big liner eastward bound
give over their first day at sea to getting used
to their new and strange surroundings, to
<a name="p428" id="p428"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>428<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>getting lost in various odd corners of the ship and
finding themselves again, to asking questions
about baggage gone astray, to wondering why
they are not seasick. As regards the two principal
characters of this narrative, nothing of
interest occurred during the first day except
that Keller went below late in the afternoon
to take a nap, and that shortly before dark,
when he had waked, Bronston limped in with
a look of pain upon his face, to report that while
watching a lifeboat drill he had got a foot hurt.</p>

<p>“A clumsy ass of a coal passer dropped his
oar and hit me right on the big toe with the
butt of it,” he explained. “I didn’t give him
away, because the second officer was right there
and I judged he would have given the poor
devil fits for being so careless. But it hurts
like the very mischief.”</p>

<p>He got his left shoe off and sat for a bit
caressing the bruised member.</p>

<p>“The skin isn’t broken evidently,” he continued,
in response to Keller’s inquiries concerning
the extent of the injury; “but there’s
some swelling and plenty of soreness.” He
started to put his shoe back on his stockinged
foot, but halted with a groan.</p>

<p>“If you don’t mind,” he said to Keller, “I’m
going to wear those heavy shoes of yours for
a day or two. They’re easier than mine and
broader in the toe.”</p>

<p>“Help yourself,” agreed Keller. “Seeing as
we’ve swapped caps we might as well swap
<a name="p429" id="p429"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>429<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>shoes too. Anyhow, I kind of like this pair
I’ve got on, even if they do pinch a little.” He
contemplated his shining extremities admiringly.
Shortly afterward they went up to
dinner. After dinner Bronston found reason
for returning to the stateroom. Here he did
a strange thing. He dropped a pair of perfectly
good shoes out of the porthole.</p>


<p class="tb"><br class="ns"
 />Conceding further that on a big liner’s second
day out the weather continues fine, the Americans
among the first-cabin passengers begin
making acquaintances; and, under official guidance,
go on trips of exploration and discovery
to the engine room and the steerage and the
steward’s domain. Card games are organised
and there is preliminary talk of a ship’s concert.
The British travellers, on the other hand,
continue for the most part to hold themselves
aloof. This also was true of the second day’s
passage of the <i>Mesopotamia</i>.</p>

<p>Keller&mdash;or Cole, to use the name which he
now used&mdash;met some congenial fellow countrymen
in the smoking room and played bridge
with them for small stakes during most of the
afternoon. Bronston, who apparently did not
care for cards, saw his warder only at the lunch
hour, preferring to spend the time in his
steamer chair upon the deck, enjoying the air,
which was balmy and neither too warm nor yet
too cool, but just right. Presently as he sat
there he fell into a conversation&mdash;which was at
<a name="p430" id="p430"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>430<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>first desultory, although it shortly took on a
more animated character&mdash;with a rather fluffy
young lady who occupied the steamer chair next
his own. She dropped a book which she had
been reading; he picked it up and returned it
to her. That was how it started, at first with
an interchange of polite commonplaces, then
with a running bestowal of small confidences
on the part of the young lady, who proved to
be talkative.</p>

<p>By bits and snatches it developed that her
name was Miss Lillian Cartwright and that
her home was in Evanston, Illinois. There
were several other Evanston people on the
boat&mdash;she pointed out a group of them some
distance down the deck&mdash;but she was not travelling
with them. She was travelling with her
uncle, Major Slocum. Perhaps her new acquaintance
had heard of her uncle, Major Slocum?
He was a prominent attorney in Chicago,
quite a prominent attorney, and he was
also on the staff of the present governor of
Illinois, and in former years had taken a deep
interest in the welfare of the Illinois National
Guard.</p>

<p>“Possibly you may have seen his name in
the papers,” she said. “Uncle is always getting
into the papers.”</p>

<p>Bronston rather thought he had heard the
name. Miss Cartwright talked on. This was
her first trip at sea. She had expected that
she would be seasick, but on the contrary she
<a name="p431" id="p431"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>431<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>felt splendid; not a suggestion of seasickness so
far. Really she felt almost disappointed&mdash;as
though she had been cheated out of something.
But seriously, wasn’t the sea just perfectly
lovely? She loved the sea. And she loved the
<i>Mesopotamia</i> too; it was so big and so roomy
and the officers were so polite; and even the
seamen were accommodating about answering
questions. She was always going to travel on
the <i>Mesopotamia</i> after this. They&mdash;her uncle
and she&mdash;were on their way to Scotland to visit
her married sister who lived there. It wasn’t
certain yet whether they would leave the ship
at Fishguard and run up to London for a day
or two, or go straight on to Liverpool and
from there take the train for Scotland and stop
off in London on the way back. Her uncle
rather favoured going on to Liverpool. Here
Bronston found a chance to slip in a word or
two.</p>

<p>“I’m sure I’ve noticed your uncle&mdash;tall, isn’t
he, and distinguished and rather military looking?
I should like very much to meet him.
You might introduce him to me, and then perhaps
he would be good enough to introduce
us two properly to each other. I answer to
the name of Brown.” He stood up and lifted
his cap. “I expect to be back in a little while.”</p>

<p>The plan seemed to please Miss Cartwright.
“That would be fun, wouldn’t it?” she said,
as Bronston moved off up the deck.</p>

<p>It is possible that she repeated to her uncle
<a name="p432" id="p432"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>432<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>what Bronston&mdash;or Brown&mdash;had said. For
when Bronston happened along again a few
minutes later, Major Slocum was sitting with
his niece, and upon being introduced, arose and
clasped Mr. Bronston’s hand with a warm
cordiality. The Major was one of those native-born
Demostheneses with a stiff spine and a
fine mane of rather long, iron-grey hair. His
manner of speech betrayed him instantly as one
addicted to after-dinner oratory. Instinctively,
as it were, one gathered that his favourite
toast was The Ladies&mdash;God Bless ’Em.</p>

<p>As he confided to his niece afterward, the
Major found this Mr. Brown to be an exceedingly
well-mannered, well-informed person; and
indeed the conversation did cover a wide range
of subjects that afternoon.</p>

<p>It first took on a briskened tone when a lone
porpoise came tumbling across the waves to race
with the ship. From porpoises the talk turned
to whales, and from whales to icebergs, and
from icebergs to disasters at sea, and from
that to discipline aboard ship, and from
that to discipline in the army and in the
national guard, which was where Major Slocum
shone. Thence very naturally it drifted to a
discussion of police discipline as it existed in
certain of the larger American cities, notably
New York and Chicago, and thence to police
corruption and crime matters generally. Here
Mr. Bronston, who had until now been third in
the conversational output, displayed a
<a name="p433" id="p433"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>433<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>considerable acquaintance with methods of crime detection.
He knew about the Bertillon system
and about finger-print identifications, and what
was more he knew how to talk about them&mdash;and
he did. There are two classes of people who
are interested in shop talk of crime&mdash;those who
know something of the subject and those who
do not. Miss Cartwright and Major Slocum
listened attentively to most of what the young
man had to say, and both professed themselves
as having been deeply entertained.</p>

<p>It followed, quite in the order of things, therefore,
that the three of them should agree to meet
in the lounge after dinner and take their coffee
together. They did meet there, and the evening
was made to pass both pleasantly and rapidly.
The Major, who told quite a considerable number
of his best stories, was surprised when eleven
o’clock arrived. Meanwhile, Keller played
bridge in the smoking room. He didn’t turn in
until after midnight, finding Bronston already
in bed.</p>

<p>At the latter’s suggestion they breakfasted
abed the following morning; and so the forenoon
was well spent when they got upon deck. Fine
weather continuing, the ship ran a steady course.
The side-to-side motion was barely perceptible.
Having finished the prescribed morning constitutional&mdash;twelve
times round the ship&mdash;Miss
Cartwright was sitting in her steamer-chair,
feeling just a wee bit lonely and finding so
smooth a crossing just a trifle monotonous,
<a name="p434" id="p434"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>434<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>when Bronston came up, looking spick and span.
She preened herself, greeting him with sprightly
words, and when after a few minutes of small
talk he offered to initiate her into the mysteries
of horse billiards, up on the boat deck,
she accepted the invitation instantly.</p>

<p>They went up and the young lady proved an
apt and willing pupil. There on the boat deck
Major Slocum presently found them. He didn’t
care to play, but he kept score for them. The
Major put the sonorous emphasis of the true
orator’s delivery into everything he said; his
calling off of the count invested it with the
solemnity and vocal beauty of a well-delivered
ritual.</p>

<p>Presently when the game was over and they
sat, all three, side by side upon a bench in the
lee of one of the huge ventilator funnels, the
younger man spoke up and said he was afraid
Miss Cartwright must be getting chilled without
a wrap. She insisted that she was perfectly
comfortable, but masterfully declaring that she
needed better protection for her shoulders than
a silken blouse and a light jacket he got up.</p>

<p>“I’ll just run down and get my grey ulster,”
he said. “I think I left it in my chair.”</p>

<p>Leaving uncle and niece together he hurried
below. True enough, his grey ulster dangled
across the arm of the steamer chair, but after
picking it up he made a trip on down to D-deck
and spent perhaps a minute in his stateroom
with the door closed. No, probably it wasn’t
<a name="p435" id="p435"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>435<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>more than half a minute that he spent there.
At any rate he was back upon the boat deck
almost immediately, holding up the coat while
Miss Cartwright slipped her arms into the
sleeves. All women like to be waited on and
most women like to wear masculine garments
of one sort or another. He buttoned the collar
about her throat and she smiled up at him her
appreciation of his thoughtfulness.</p>

<p>“Aren’t men’s overcoats just adorable!” she
babbled; “so big and warm and comfy and
everything! And they have such lovely big
pockets! The very next coat I get is going to
be made like a man’s, and have some of those
nice big pockets in it.” She shoved her hands
deep into the side pockets in what she fondly
conceived to be a mannish manner.</p>

<p>“Why, what’s this?” she asked. “There’s
something heavy and jingly <span class="nw">in&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>She stopped short, for the owner of the ulster
was looking at her meaningly and shaking his
head as a signal for silence.</p>

<p>“What did you say, my dear?” inquired her
uncle absently.</p>

<p>“Nothing,” she answered, but her fingers
continued to explore the depths of the pocket,
and into her eyes came a half-puzzled, half-excited
look. She opened her lips as though to
speak, then closed them with an effort.</p>

<p>Bronston proposed another go at horse billiards&mdash;just
a short game before luncheon.
Again the Major volunteered to score for them.
<a name="p436" id="p436"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>436<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>The game was still going on when Keller appeared.
He stopped within easy hailing distance
of the trio.</p>

<p>“About ready for luncheon?” he called out,
addressing Bronston.</p>

<p>“Just a minute or so,” answered Bronston,
and went on showing his pupil how to make a
certain shot.</p>

<p>Keller took a turn up and down the deck.
He felt rather out of the picture somehow. His
appetite was active too; trust the North Atlantic
air for that. He took a turn or two more,
growing hungrier with every step. Five minutes
passed, and still the game showed no sign
of breaking up. He swung about and approached
them.</p>

<p>“Say,” he said, seeking to put a subtle shade
of meaning into his words, “I’d like to go to
lunch&mdash;if you don’t mind.”</p>

<p>“Oh, very well,” said Bronston; “we’ll stop,
then.” Keller advanced until he was quite
near them. As he did so he became aware that
Miss Cartwright was staring hard at him.
Bronston, all of a sudden, seemed to remember
the small proprieties of the occasion.</p>

<p>“Miss Cartwright, Major Slocum,” he said,
“this is my&mdash;this is Mr.&mdash;” he hesitated the
merest fraction of a second&mdash;“Mr. Cole, who
is travelling with me this trip.”</p>

<p>Miss Cartwright nodded, the Major bowed,
Keller pulled off his cap. They descended the
steps in a straggling procession, Miss
<a name="p437" id="p437"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>437<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>Cartwright and Bronston being in front, the Major
next and Keller bringing up the rear. At the
foot of the stairs Bronston addressed the young
lady.</p>

<p>“I’ll relieve you of my coat now,” he said.
“I’m afraid you did find it rather heavy.” He
looked straight into her eyes as he spoke and
touched his lips with a forefinger. She nodded
back to show she thoroughly understood the
signal, and then he took the ulster across his
arm and he and Keller moved on ahead.</p>

<p>“Look here, Bronston,” grumbled Keller
when they were out of earshot of the Major
and his niece, “you acted kind of funny up
yonder. It looked to me like you didn’t care
much about introducing me to your swell
friends.”</p>

<p>“To tell you the truth,” apologised Bronston,
“I forgot for the moment what your travelling
name was&mdash;couldn’t remember whether it was
Cole, or something else. That’s why I hung
fire. It did make the situation a bit awkward,
didn’t it? I’m sorry.”</p>

<p>“Oh, all right,” said Keller; “that explains
it. But I was a little sore just for a minute.”</p>

<p>At the door leading into the first cross hall
Bronston glanced back over his shoulder. Miss
Cartwright and her uncle were not following
them. They had halted upon an untenanted
stretch of deck, and the young woman was
saying something to her uncle and accenting
with gestures what she said. Her hands moved
<a name="p438" id="p438"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>438<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>with the briskness which generally accompanies
an eager disclosure of important tidings. The
Major, his stately head bent to hear her, was
nevertheless looking at the vanishing figures
of the two men.</p>

<p>Bronston smiled gently to himself as he and
Keller crossed the threshold and headed for
the dining saloon. He didn’t go near Miss
Cartwright or Major Slocum again that day,
but in the course of the afternoon he, watching
from a distance, saw her in earnest conversation
with two of her friends from Evanston&mdash;and
both of these two were women. Immediately
Bronston went below and stayed there.
He didn’t even get up for dinner. The excuse
he gave Keller, when Keller came in at dinnertime,
was that he wanted to go over some
papers connected with his case. The small
desk at which he sat was littered with papers
and he was steadily making notes upon a scratch
pad. He asked Keller to ask their dining-room
steward to bring him a light meal upon a
tray.</p>

<p>At this point we digress, in order to drag in
the fact that this ship, the <i>Mesopotamia</i>, was
one of the largest ships afloat at this time.
The following year there would be bigger ones
in commission, but for the moment she ranked
among the largest. She was over eight hundred
feet long and of a beam measurement and
a hull depth to correspond; but even upon a
craft of such amplified proportions as this was
<a name="p439" id="p439"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>439<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>news travels with amazing rapidity, especially
if it be news calculated to arouse and to excite.
Such a ship might be likened to a small, compact
town set afloat, with all the social ramifications
of a small town and with all of a small
town’s curiosity regarding the private affairs
of the neighbours. Ashore gossip flies swiftly
enough, goodness only knows; at sea it flits
from point to point, as if on the wings of the
swallow. What one knows every one else
knows, and knows it very soon too.</p>

<p>The digression is concluded. Let us return
to the main thread of our narrative. Let us go
back to the joint occupants of D-forty.</p>

<p>It was nine-twenty that same evening when
Keller broke in upon his companion, who sat
at the little desk, still busied with his writing.
Keller seemed flustered, not to say indignant.
He slammed the door behind him viciously.</p>

<p>“Somebody’s on,” he stated, speaking with
disconsolate conviction. “I know I haven’t
said anything, and it don’t stand to reason
that you’d be talking; but they’re on.”</p>

<p>“On what?” inquired Bronston calmly.</p>

<p>“On to us&mdash;that’s what! It’s leaked out
who we are.”</p>

<p>“What makes you think that?”</p>

<p>“I don’t think anything about it&mdash;I know.
I’ve got the proofs. We had our little game
all fixed up for to-night&mdash;me and the same
three fellows I’ve been playing with right along;
but when I looked them up in the smoking
<a name="p440" id="p440"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>440<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>room after dinner they all three excused themselves&mdash;said
they didn’t feel like playing.
Well, that was all right, but a little later I saw
Latham and Levy joining in a game with two
other men, both strangers to me. So I tried
to get into another game that was just starting
up, and the fellows there horned me out. I
could tell they didn’t want to be playing with
me. And going through the lounge I tumbled,
all of a sudden, to the fact that all the people
there, men and women both, were looking hard
at me and nodding to one another&mdash;get what
I mean? Maybe they didn’t think I saw them&mdash;I
didn’t let on, of course&mdash;but I did see ’em.
I tell you they’re on. Say, what do you know
about a lot of stuck-up people passing up a
man cold, just because they’ve found out some
way that he’s a private detective?”</p>

<p>Overcome by his feelings he snorted in disgust.
Then added, as an afterthought: “Well,
what’s the next move? What do you think
we’d better do now?”</p>

<p>Bronston considered a moment before answering.</p>

<p>“If your suspicions are correct I take it
the best thing for us to do is to stay away
from the other passengers as much as we possibly
can during the rest of this trip. At least
that’s what I figure on doing&mdash;with your consent.”</p>

<p>“How about that Miss What’s-her-name,
the girl who was with you this morning?”
<a name="p441" id="p441"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>441<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>asked Keller. “How are you going to cut her
out?”</p>

<p>“That’s simple enough&mdash;merely by not going
near her, that’s all,” said Bronston. “Admitting
that you are right and that we have been
recognised, the young woman probably wouldn’t
care to be seen in my company anyhow. As
things seem to stand now it might be embarrassing
for her.”</p>

<p>“I guess you’ve got the right dope,” said
Keller. “If anybody objects to my company
they know what they can do. What do you
figure on doing&mdash;sticking here in the room?”</p>

<p>“Remaining in a stateroom for a day or so
won’t be much of a privation to a man who
faces the prospect of being locked up in an
English jail indefinitely,” said Bronston. “It’ll
merely be a sort of preliminary training. Besides,
we ought to reach shore to-morrow night
or the next morning. I shall certainly stay
where I am.”</p>

<p>“Me too, I guess,” said Keller dolorously.
“I sure was enjoying that little game, though.”</p>

<p>After all, as it turned out, Keller wouldn’t
have cared to leave his quarters anyhow on
the next day. For overnight the sea, so placid
and benignant until now, developed a passing
fit of temperament. In the morning the sea
wasn’t exactly what you would call rough, but
on the other hand it wasn’t exactly what you
would call absolutely smooth; and Keller, being
a green traveller, awoke with a headache and a
<a name="p442" id="p442"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>442<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>feeling of squeamishness in his stomach, and
found it no privation to remain upon the flat
of his back. Except for a trip to the bathroom
Bronston did not venture out of the room either.
He read and wrote and smoked and had his
meals brought to him. Keller couldn’t touch
food.</p>

<p>So the situation stood in the middle of the
afternoon when there came a gentle knock at
the door. Keller was dozing then, but roused
himself as Bronston called out to know what
was wanted. The voice which answered
through the panels was the voice of their bedroom
steward, Lawrence.</p>

<p>“I’ve a wireless, sir,” he said; “just received
from the coast. It’s addressed to ‘Sharkey
Agency’s Operative, aboard Steamship <i>Mesopotamia</i>,’
and the wireless operator brought it to
the purser, sir, and the purser told me to bring
it to this stateroom. Was that right, sir?”</p>

<p>Keller sat up with a groan. His head was
swimming.</p>

<p>“Stay where you are,” said Bronston; “I’ll
get it for you”; and before Keller could swing
his feet to the floor Bronston had unbolted the
door and had taken the message from Lawrence’s
hand. The steward, standing outside, had
time only to murmur his inevitable “Thank you,
sir,” and catch one peep at the interior of the
stateroom before the door was closed in his
face. Bronston turned and handed the sealed
envelope to Keller.</p>

<p><a name="p443" id="p443"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>443<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span>“What did I tell you last night about ’em
all being on?” said Keller. “A message comes
with no name on it, and yet they know right
where to send it. And, say, did you get a
flash at the look on that steward’s face? Somebody’s
been telling that guy something too.”</p>

<p>He opened the brown envelope and glanced
at the small sheet that it contained. “The
London officer will meet us at Liverpool,” he
said, as he crumpled the paper and tossed it
aside. “We land at the other place first,
don’t we&mdash;Fishhawk, or whatever its name is?”</p>

<p>“Fishguard,” Bronston told him. “Or rather,
we stop off Fishguard, and tenders come out
to meet us and to take off mail and passengers.
Then the ship goes on to Liverpool.”</p>

<p>“Good enough,” said Keller. “You and me
will stay right here in this stateroom until we
get to Liverpool; that’ll be some time to-morrow,
won’t it?”</p>

<p>“To-morrow afternoon, probably,” said Bronston.
He went back to his writing, whistling a
little tune to himself.</p>

<p>The precaution of the overcareful Keller
proved unnecessary, because in the morning
word was brought by the bathroom steward
that a notice had just been posted in the gangway
opposite the purser’s desk announcing that
because of the roughness of the channel the
liner would proceed straight to Liverpool without
stopping off Fishguard at all. Nevertheless,
the detective kept the stateroom door
<a name="p444" id="p444"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>444<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>locked. With land in sight he was taking no
chances at all.</p>

<p>Since their stateroom was on the port side
and the hills of Wales stood up out of the sea
upon the other side, they saw nothing of Fishguard
as the <i>Mesopotamia</i> steamed on up the
choppy channel. Mainly they both were silent;
each was busy with his own thoughts and
speculations. Hampered in their movements
by the narrow confines of their quarters they
packed their large bags and their small ones,
packing them with care and circumspection,
the better to kill the time that hung upon their
hands. Finally Bronston, becoming dissatisfied
with his own bestowal of his belongings,
called in the handy Lawrence to do the job
all over again for him.</p>

<p>As the shifting view through their porthole
presently told them, they left the broad channel
for the twistywise river. The lightships which
dot the Mersey above its mouth, like street-lamps
along a street, were sliding by when Lawrence
knocked upon the door to ask if the luggage
was ready for shore. He was told to return
in a few minutes; but instead of going
away he waited outside in the little corridor.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Keller, “I guess we’d better be
getting up on deck, hadn’t we?” He glanced
sidewise at the shiny steel cuffs, which he had
fished out from an ulster pocket and which lay
upon the rumpled covers of his bed. Alongside
them was the key of the door.</p>

<p><a name="p445" id="p445"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>445<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span>“I suppose so,” said Bronston indifferently;
“I’ll be with you in a minute.” With his back
half turned to Keller he was adjusting the
seemingly refractory buckle of a strap which
belonged about one of the valises. He had
found it necessary to remove the strap from
the bag.</p>

<p>“Hello, what’s this?” he said suddenly.
The surprise in his tone made Keller look.
Bronston had leaned across the foot of his bed
and from a wall pocket low down against the
wainscoting had extracted something.</p>

<p>“Why, it’s a razor,” he said, holding it up;
“and what’s more it looks like your razor&mdash;the
one you thought you’d lost.”</p>

<p>“That’s what it is,” said Keller, taking it
from him. “I wonder how in thunder it got
itself hid there? I’ll stick it in my pocket.”</p>

<p>“Better not,” advised Bronston. “If I’m not
mistaken it is against the English law to carry
a razor upon the person. A locked valise would
be a better place for it, I should say.”</p>

<p>“I guess you’re right,” agreed Keller. “In
a strange country it’s just as well to be careful.”</p>

<p>He turned and stooped down, fumbling with
the hasps upon his small handbag. As he did,
something supple and quick descended in a
loop over his head and shoulders. In an instantaneous
flash of alarm he sensed that it
was the same broad strap which he had seen
a moment before in the hands of the other man.
As he straightened with an exclamation of
<a name="p446" id="p446"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>446<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>surprise, the strap was violently tightened from
behind, the tough leather squeaking under the
strain as the tongue of the buckle slipped
through a handy hole; and there he was,
trussed fast about the middle, with his arms
bound down against his sides just at the elbows,
so that his lower arms flapped in the futile
fashion of a penguin’s wings. He cried out
then, cursing and wriggling and straining. But
a man who would have been his equal in bodily
vigour even though his limbs were unhampered
was upon him from the rear, pitching him forward
on his bed, face downward, wrestling
him over on his side, muffling his face in a
twist of bed clothing, then forcing his wrists
together and holding them so while there was
a jingle of steel chain and a snapping together
of steel jaws. Half suffocated under the weight
of his antagonist, with his mouth full of blanket
and his eyes blinded, overpowered, tricked, all
but helpless, lashing out with his feet in a vain
protest against this mishandling, Keller now
was dimly aware of a wallet being hurriedly
removed from his breast-pocket and of something
else of equal bulk being substituted for
it. Then he was yanked upon his feet, a cap
was jammed upon his head, the leather noose
about his body was cast off, and he stood unsteadily&mdash;a
composite picture of dishevelment,
dismay, chagrin and rage&mdash;wearing upon his
two clamped hands the same gyves which his
conqueror had worn when they boarded the ship.</p>

<p><a name="p447" id="p447"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>447<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span>“You’ll pay for this&mdash;I’ll make you pay for
this!” he sputtered. “I’ll show you up! Damn
you, take these things off of me!” and he
tugged impotently at his bonds until his wrist-bones
threatened to dislocate themselves. “You
ain’t got a chance to get away with this&mdash;not
a chance,” he cried. “I’ll raise this whole ship!
<span class="nw">I’ll&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>“Rest perfectly easy,” said Bronston calmly,
soothingly almost, as he flung the strap aside
and stepped back. “The ship has already
been raised, or a part of it. If you weren’t so
excited you would know that our friend Lawrence
has been trying to get in the door for the
last half minute or so. I think he must have
heard you kicking. Let us admit him.”</p>

<p>He had the key in his hands&mdash;in the stress
and fever of the encounter he had even remembered,
this thoughtful man, to secure the key.
And now, with his eyes turned toward the captive,
who remained stupefied at this inexplicable
man&oelig;uvre, he was stepping backward and unfastening
the door, and swinging it open for the
admission of the astounded servant.</p>

<p>“Lawrence,” snapped Bronston in the voice
of authority and command, “I want you. My
man here tried to give me the slip and I had
to use a little violence to secure him. Bring
these bags and come along with us to the deck.
I shall possibly need your help in making the
explanations which may be necessary. Understand,
don’t you?”</p>

<p><a name="p448" id="p448"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>448<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span>Reaching backward, he slipped a shining
gold coin into Lawrence’s palm; he slid into a
grey ulster; he advanced a step and fastened
a firm hand upon the crook of Keller’s fettered
right arm. Involuntarily the captive sought to
pull away.</p>

<p>“I keep telling you you ain’t got a chance,”
he blurted. “I’ll go to the <span class="nw">captain&mdash;&mdash;</span>”</p>

<p>“No, my noisy friend, you won’t go to the
captain,” Bronston broke in on his tirade,
“but you’ll be taken to him.” With a forward
swing he thrust Keller across the threshold and
they bumped together in the narrow cross hall.
“Come along now, Lawrence, and look sharp,”
he bade the pop-eyed steward over his shoulder.</p>

<p>We may briefly sketch the details of the trip
through the passageway, and up the steps from
D-deck to C-deck and from C-deck to B, for
really it occupied less time than would be required
for a proper description of it. Suffice it
to say that it was marked by many protestations
and by frequent oaths and by one or two crisp
commands and once by a small suggestion of a
struggle. These sounds heralded the progress
of the trio as they moved bumpingly along, so
that the first officer, catching untoward noises
which rose above the chatter of the passengers
who surrounded him, garbed and ready for the
shore, stepped back from the deck into the
cabin foyer, followed by a few first-cabin folk
who, like him, had heard the clamour and had
gathered that something unusual must be afoot.</p>

<p><a name="p449" id="p449"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>449<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span>The first officer barred the way of the procession.
He was a competent and self-possessed
young man, else he would not have been the
first officer. At sight of his brass buttons and
gold-braided sleeves Keller, still striving to cast
off Bronston’s hold, emitted a cry of relief.</p>

<p>“Captain! Captain!” he yelled; “listen to
me. Listen to me a minute, please.”</p>

<p>“The captain is on the bridge until the ship
has docked,” answered the uniformed one. “I
am the first officer. What is the trouble?”</p>

<p>“There is no trouble&mdash;now.” It was Bronston
speaking; speaking authoritatively and
without outward signs of excitement. “Would
you care to hear what I have to say, Mr.
Officer?”</p>

<p>“I would.”</p>

<p>“But, see here, I’m the one that’s got a right
to do the talking,” burst in a frenzied gurgle
from the sorely beset Keller. “You listen to
me. This is an outrage!”</p>

<p>“One at a time,” quoth the first officer in
the voice of one accustomed to having his orders
obeyed. “Proceed,” he bade Bronston.</p>

<p>“You may have heard,” stated Bronston,
“that we are a detective and a prisoner. I believe
there has been talk to that effect on board
here for the past day or two.”</p>

<p>The first officer&mdash;his name was Watts&mdash;nodded
to indicate that such rumours had come to
his ears.</p>

<p>“Very well, then,” went on Bronston; “my
<a name="p450" id="p450"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>450<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>man here will probably claim he is being kidnapped.
That is his last hope.” He smiled
at this. “He tried to get away from me a bit
ago. We had a tussle. The steward here
heard us struggling. I overpowered him and
ironed him. Now, for reasons best known to
himself, I apprehend that he will claim that he
is really the detective and that I am really the
prisoner. Will you kindly look at us both and
tell me, in your opinion, which is which?”</p>

<p>Dispassionately, judicially, First Officer
Watts considered the pair facing him, while
curious spectators crowded together in a semicircle
behind him and a thickening stream of
other first-cabin passengers poured in from off
the deck, jostling up closely to feast their gaping
eyes upon so sensational an episode. It took
the young Englishman only a moment or two
to make up his mind; a quick scrutiny was for
him amply sufficient. For one of these men
stood at ease; well set up, confident, not noticeably
rumpled as to attire or flustered as to bearing.
But the other: His coat was bunched up
on his back, one trouser leg was pulled half
way up his shin; his mussed hair was in his
eyes; his cap was over one ear; his eyes undoubtedly
had a most wild and desperate look;
from his mouth came vain words and ravings.
Finally there were those handcuffs. Handcuffs,
considered as such, may not signify guilt, yet
somehow they typify it. So far as First Officer
Watts was concerned those handcuffs clinched
<a name="p451" id="p451"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>451<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>the case. To his understanding they were
<i>prima facie</i> evidence, exceedingly plausible
and highly convincing. Promptly he delivered
his opinion. It was significant that, in
so doing, he addressed Bronston and ignored
Keller:</p>

<p>“I’m bound to say, sir, the appearances are
in favour of you. But there should be other
proof, don’t you think&mdash;papers or something?”</p>

<p>“Certainly,” agreed Bronston. He drew a
red leather wallet from his own breast-pocket
and handed it over to Watts. Then, working
deftly, he extracted half a dozen letters and a
sheaf of manuscript notes from an inner pocket
of Keller’s coat and tendered them for examination;
which crowning indignity rendered
Keller practically inarticulate with madness.
Watts scanned these exhibits briefly, paying
particular attention to a formal-looking document
which he drew from the red wallet.</p>

<p>“These things seem to confirm what you
say,” was his comment. He continued, however,
to hold the written and printed testimony
in his hands. He glanced at the impressive
document again. “Hold on; this description of
the man who is wanted says he has a moustache?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m going to offer you other proof,
plenty of it,” Bronston promised, cutting in on
Keller, who grew more incoherently vocal with
each moment. “Would you be so good as to
send for the ship’s barber?”</p>

<p><a name="p452" id="p452"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>452<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span>“Bring the barber!” ordered Watts of a wide-eyed
cabin boy.</p>

<p>“This steward has served us since we came
aboard,” went on Bronston, indicating Lawrence.
“Now, my man, I want you to tell
the truth. Which of us two seemed to be in
charge on the night you first saw us&mdash;the night
we came aboard&mdash;this man or I?”</p>

<p>“You, sir,” answered Lawrence. “I recall
quite distinctly that ’twas you spoke to me
about the ’eavy luggage.”</p>

<p>“Who took from you the wireless message
which you brought yesterday to our stateroom,
addressed to the representative of the Sharkey
Detective Agency?”</p>

<p>“You, sir.”</p>

<p>“Who handed you your tip a few minutes
ago for serving us during the voyage?”</p>

<p>“You did, thank you, sir.”</p>

<p>A figure of dignity pushed forward through
the ring of excited spectators and a sonorous,
compelling voice was raised impressively. Major
Slocum had been late in arriving upon the
scene, but what he now said earned for him
instant attention.</p>

<p>“Mr. Officer,” announced the Major with a
gesture which comprehended the central pair
of figures, “you may accept it from me as an
absolute and indisputable fact that this gentleman,
who calls himself Brown, is a bona-fide
detective. I gleaned as much from my conversation
with him upon the occasion of our first
<a name="p453" id="p453"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>453<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>meeting. He evinced a wide knowledge of
police matters. Of the other person I know
nothing, except that, since Brown is the detective,
he must perforce be the prisoner.” He
cleared his throat before going on:</p>

<p>“Moreover, deeply though I regret to bring
a lady, and especially a young lady, into a controversy
involving a person who is charged
with crime”&mdash;here he blighted the hapless
Keller with a glare&mdash;“deeply as I regret it, I
may say that my niece is in position to supply
further evidence.”</p>

<p>The crowd parted to admit Miss Lillian
Cartwright, then closed in behind her. Excitement
flushed the young lady’s cheeks becomingly.
The first officer bowed to her:</p>

<p>“Pardon me, miss, but would you mind telling
us what you know?”</p>

<p>“Why, I’ve known for two days&mdash;no, three
days, I think&mdash;who they were,” stated Miss
Cartwright. “Mr. Brown&mdash;the detective, you
know&mdash;loaned me his ulster the other morning;
and when I put it on I felt something&mdash;something
heavy that jingled in the pocket. Mr.
Brown didn’t seem to want me to take it out
or speak about it. But at the very first chance
I peeped in the pocket, and it was a pair of
handcuffs. I’d never seen any handcuffs before&mdash;closely,
I mean&mdash;so I peeped at them several
times. They are the same handcuffs that are
on that man now.”</p>

<p>“That was my overcoat he loaned you!”
<a name="p454" id="p454"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>454<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>yelled Keller, waving his coupled hands up and
down in his desperate yearning to be heard in
his own defence. “Those handcuffs were in
my overcoat pocket, I tell you, not in his.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” contradicted Miss Cartwright,
most positively. “Yours is a brown ulster.
I’ve seen you wearing it evenings on the deck.
And this was a dark-grey ulster, the same one
that Mr. Brown is wearing this very minute.</p>

<p>“And I remember, too, that on that very
same morning you came up and asked Mr.
Brown to take you to lunch, or rather you
asked him to go to lunch so that you could go,
too. You spoke to him twice about it&mdash;quite
humbly, I thought.”</p>

<p>There were murmurs of applause at this.
Another voice, unheard until now, spoke out,
rising above the confused babbling. It was the
voice of a sophisticated New Yorker addressing
an equally sophisticated friend:</p>

<p>“There’s nothing to it, Herman! Look at
those feet on Brown. Nobody but a bull would
be wearing shoes like that. And pipe the plaid
lid&mdash;a regulation plain-clothes man’s get-up,
the whole thing is.”</p>

<p>“But those are my shoes he’s wearing,”
wailed Keller, feeling the trap closing in upon
him from every side. “Those are my shoes&mdash;I
loaned ’em to him.”</p>

<p>“Lawrence,” said Bronston, “you’ve been
giving our shoes to Boots and getting them back
from him, haven’t you?”</p>

<p><a name="p455" id="p455"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>455<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Are these shoes which I have on now the
same shoes I’ve been wearing right along?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, sir, the same boots!”</p>

<p>“When you helped me pack my luggage to-day,
did you notice any other shoes?”</p>

<p>“No, sir.”</p>

<p>“I wasn’t in my stocking feet when I came
aboard, was I?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, indeed, sir.” This with a respectful
smile.</p>

<p>“Then these must be the only shoes I have
or have had, mustn’t they?”</p>

<p>Before Lawrence could make answer to this
question the ship’s barber appeared at the first
officer’s elbow, touching his cap.</p>

<p>“You wanted me, sir?” he asked.</p>

<p>“I wanted you,” put in Bronston. “Look at
me closely, please. How long would you say
that it has been since I wore a moustache?”</p>

<p>With the air of a scientist examining a rare
and interesting specimen, the barber considered
the speaker’s upper lip.</p>

<p>“Not for some months, sir, I should say,” he
announced with professional gravity, while all
the audience craned their necks to hear his
words.</p>

<p>“Now, then,” said Bronston, yanking Keller
forward into the full light, “would you please
look this prisoner over and tell us how long, in
your opinion, it has been since he wore a moustache?”</p>

<p><a name="p456" id="p456"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>456<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span>A pause ensued; all waited for the decision.</p>

<p>“I should say, sir,” stated the barber at the
end of half a minute, “that ’e’s been wearing
a moustache lately&mdash;I should say that ’e must
’ave took it off quite recently. ’Is upper lip
is still tender&mdash;tenderer than the rest of ’is
face.”</p>

<p>“But I took it off since we sailed,” blared
Keller. He turned furiously on Bronston.
“Damn you, you conned me into taking it off!”</p>

<p>“Why should I do that?” parried Bronston
coolly; his manner changed, becoming accusing.
“Why should I persuade you to cut off the
principal distinguishing mark as set forth in
the description that was sent to our people
from London, the thing which aided me in
tracing and finding you?”</p>

<p>A sputtered bellow was the answer from
Keller, and a suggestion of applause the response
from the crowd. The popular verdict
had been rendered. Before the tribunal of the
onlookers the prisoner stood convicted of being
rightfully and properly a prisoner. Even in
his present state Keller realised this, and
filled for the moment with a sullen resignation
he dropped his manacled hands.</p>

<p>“Remember,” he groaned, “somebody’ll pay
out big damages if you let this man off this
ship. That’s all I’ve got to say now. He
tricked me and he’ll trick you, too, if he can!”</p>

<p>“Mr. First Officer,” said Bronston, “hasn’t
this farce gone far enough? Is there any
<a name="p457" id="p457"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>457<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>lingering doubt in your mind regarding our proper
identities?”</p>

<p>The first officer shook his head. “I am satisfied,”
he said with unqualified conviction in his
words; “quite satisfied. Indeed, sir, I was
satisfied from the beginning. I only wished to
be absolutely sure.”</p>

<p>“I thought as much,” said Bronston. “I
am expecting a man from Scotland Yard to
meet us here at Liverpool. Would you please
bring him to me here? This man is dangerous,
and I prefer to have assistance before taking
him off the boat. Kindly explain the situation
to the Scotland Yard man as he comes aboard,
will you, please, and ask him to hurry.”</p>

<p>“I understand,” said Mr. Watts, moving
back. “Clear the way, please,” he bade those
about him. “We are about to dock, I think.”</p>

<p>He was a bit late. The steamer had already
swung to, broadside, alongside the long landing
stage, and just as Mr. Watts, in a great hurry,
reached the rail, the gangway went out. But
before the first eager shoregoer could start
down it, a square-jawed, stockily-built man,
with short side whiskers, came briskly up it
from the other end. He spoke ten words to
the first officer, and the first officer, escorting
him, bored back through the press to the foyer,
explaining the situation in crisp sentences, as
he made a path for the newcomer to the spot
where Bronston, with his legs braced, was jamming
the blasphemous and struggling Keller
<a name="p458" id="p458"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>458<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>into an angle of the cabin wall. For Keller
had once more grown violent. At sight of
this the square-jawed man jumped forward to
lend a hand.</p>

<p>“Inspector Drew, from Scotland Yard,” he
said, by way of introduction for himself as he
grabbed for one of Keller’s flailing legs.</p>

<p>“All right, inspector,” answered Bronston,
between hard-set teeth. “I’m glad to see you.
I’m having trouble handling our man.”</p>

<p>“So I see,” said Drew, “but we’ll cure that
in a jiffy.” He cured it by the expedient of
throwing the whole weight of his body upon
Keller. Together he and Bronston pressed the
captive flat and helpless against the woodwork.</p>

<p>“The boat train is waiting,” panted Drew in
Bronston’s ear. “Shall we get our man
aboard?”</p>

<p>“I’m not going on any train!” snorted Keller,
his voice rising to an agonised shriek.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, but you are, me beauty!” said the
inspector. “Get him by the other arm,” he
told Bronston. “I’ll take care of him on this
side.”</p>

<p>Propelled by an irresistible force, held fast
by strong grips upon his coat-collar and his
elbows, shoved along, while his feet dragged
and scuffled under him and his pinioned hands
waggled the air impotently, hurried on so fast
that his profane sputterings gurgled and died
in his throat&mdash;thus and after such a fashion
did the hapless, helpless Keller travel across
<a name="p459" id="p459"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>459<span class="ns">]
 </span></span>the deck and through the crowd, which parted
before him and closed in behind; thus did he
progress, without halt, across the landing dock,
on past the stand of the customs office and
out at the other side of the dock, where, upon
tracks that ran along the quay, a train stood
with steam up. Bodily he was flung in at an
open coach door; roughly he was spun about
and deposited like a sack of oats upon the seat
of a compartment, and Inspector Drew, gasping
for breath but triumphant, shoved a knee
into his heaving chest to keep him there.</p>

<p>“Whew, that was a job!” puffed Bronston,
releasing his grasp of their still feebly struggling
charge. “Inspector, can you keep him where
he is for just a minute or two? I’ll see to it
that the baggage is brought here.”</p>

<p>“I can keep the gentleman quiet,” said
Drew, mending his grip and shoving down
hard upon the wriggling human cushion beneath
him.</p>

<p>“For God’s sake, don’t let him get away!
<span class="nw">Don’t&mdash;&mdash;</span>” The rest was but muffled gurglings
and snortings, made meaningless and
wordless by a sinewy, tweed-clad forearm,
which was jammed across poor Keller’s face
with crushing and extinguishing violence.</p>

<p>“Go get your baggage,” panted Inspector
Drew. “He’ll stay right ’ere with me, no fear.”
So Bronston stepped down out of the compartment
and slammed the door fast behind
him.</p>

<p><a name="p460" id="p460"></a><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>460<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span>As the passengers of the <i>Mesopotamia</i> come
swarming aboard the boat train, and as the
boat train prepares to pull out for London, we
may as well leave the inspector and the handcuffed
detective wrestling there together in the
narrow confines of that English railway compartment.</p>

<p>Because that was where Bronston left them.</p>

this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
